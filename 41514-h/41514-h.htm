<h2>BRUNO<br />
CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>We do not count the first half-year of our
married life, because, during that time
we did not live, we boarded.</p>

<p>Then we found we had developed a strong
appetite for housekeeping, so we began to look
about us for a house.</p>

<p>In the small northern village where we must
live, it was not possible to rent anything that
suited us; so we decided to take what we could
get until we could manage to build what we
wanted.</p>

<p>The house we took was one which had originally
been built out in the country, but the
town had crept around it until it now seemed
to be almost in the heart of the village.</p>

<p>While we were furnishing and embellishing
this our first home, was, I think, the most
entirely happy time of our lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>Julius often said, "I know now why the birds
always sing so joyously when they are building
their nests."</p>

<p>We were just beginning to feel settled, when
a letter came to Julius from his only sister, who
lived in a city. It was not unusual for him to
have letters from her, but this particular letter
stands by itself.</p>

<p>It had a postscript!</p>

<p>The postscript said: "Would you like a nice
dog? The children have had a valuable puppy,
seven months old, given to them, and we cannot
keep him here, in a flat. He is half setter and
half water-spaniel; pure on both sides. We call
him 'Bruno.'"</p>

<p>How our dignity increased at the idea of owning
live-stock! So far we had only achieved
a cat, who had by this time achieved kittens.
But a dog! That was something like! It
did not take us long to decide and send off an
enthusiastic acceptance. Then another letter
came, saying that Bruno had started on the
journey us-ward.</p>

<p>The next afternoon a colored car-porter
walked into Julius's place of business escorting
a shaggy brown dog by a chain fastened
to his collar. We have never known just what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
transpired during that eighteen hours' journey;
but something notable there certainly was, for
Bruno could never endure the sight or presence
of a negro from that time as long as he lived.
He seemed utterly humiliated and dejected when
he was led in.</p>

<p>Julius looked up from his day-book, and
exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is that you, Bruno? How are you, old
fellow?" At the sound of his name, Bruno
raised his ears, wrinkled his forehead, and cocked
his head on one side inquiringly. Julius stroked
and patted him, and Bruno was won.</p>

<p>I was sitting at home busily sewing, when I
was startled by a great clatter out on the sidewalk.
I looked, and there came Julius leading&mdash;puppy,
indeed! A dog nearly as big as a
calf! I had expected a baby-dog in a basket!</p>

<p>He was a beauty,&mdash;his hair just the color
that is called auburn or red, when humans
have it. He sniffed me over approvingly, and
let me hug his beautiful head.</p>

<p>We took off the chain, and watched him roll
and bathe himself in the high grass of the back
yard. He had probably never seen such grass
before, and he could not express his delight
with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>There was a three-cornered discussion at bedtime
about where our new pet was to sleep.
Julius and I did the talking, while Bruno sat
upright&mdash;I called it "standing up before, and
sitting down behind," his ears cocked up, looking
from one to the other as we spoke, seeming
to understand all that was said. It was finally
decided to make him a bed on the floor beside
ours, so that he would not be lonesome.</p>

<p>Several times in the night we were startled
by his cries. He moaned and whined in his
sleep,&mdash;evidently having bad dreams. Julius
would call to him until he was broad awake,
then reach down and pat him till his tail began
to thump the floor, and he would rise and wind
himself up by going round and round on his
bed, then drop, to go off again into an uneasy
snooze. We did not sleep much. Towards
morning we were awakened from a first sound
nap, finding ourselves violently crowded and
pushed. Julius sprang out of bed and lighted
a candle. There was Bruno monopolizing half
of our bed.</p>

<p>It was daylight before we could convince him
that his bed was on the floor and that he was
expected to occupy it.</p>

<p>The next afternoon, I ventured to take Bruno<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
for a walk. I had tied a broad light-blue ribbon
in a big bow round his neck, which contrasted
beautifully with his auburn curls. I felt very
proud of his appearance, and he also eyed me
with a look of satisfaction. Alas! "Pride
goeth before a fall, and a haughty spirit before
destruction."</p>

<p>As we crossed a street that ran at right angles
with the one we were gracing, Bruno, looking
down its vista, caught sight of what was probably
the first flock of hens he had ever seen.</p>

<p>All the setter in him sprang to the fore, and
in a flash he was off after them. Without a
thought, I followed. Up and down the street
we sped,&mdash;he after the one speckled hen he had
singled out, and I after him, shrieking to him,
and making lunges at him with my parasol, as
he and the hen rushed by me.</p>

<p>Finally the distracted Biddy, squawking,
cackling, and with outspread wings, found the
hole under the fence through which the others
had escaped and disappeared, leaving us to view
the ruins, heated and dishevelled, with smashed
parasol, muddy feet, draggled ribbon, and vanished
dignity.</p>

<p>After some half-hysterical reproaches from
me, which Bruno listened to with drooping ears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and tail, we turned, demoralized and dejected, to
wend our way homeward, I mentally congratulating
myself that the streets were deserted. I
shuddered to think of the probable consequences
if it had happened after school hours when the
small boy was abroad.</p>

<p>So far we had managed to prevent a meeting
between Bruno and Rebecca.</p>

<p>Bruno was to us such an uncertain quantity
that we feared the result of their first glimpse
of each other. So the box containing Rebecca's
kittens had been kept out in the stable, and her
food carried out to her to prevent the dreaded
meeting. I wearied of the daily forced marches
stable-ward, though, and longed to have them
within reach. So, one evening after Julius
came home from the office, we, in fear and
trembling, brought in the box, and mounted
guard to watch developments.</p>

<p>Bruno looked curious, sniffed, and then drew
nearer. I sat down on the floor to be ready
to defend them, while Julius stood behind
Bruno.</p>

<p>As soon as he spied the kits, his ears rose and
he was all alert. Then gradually he seemed to
realize, from our way of proceeding, that they
were not fair game. His ears drooped forward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
his tail began to wag, and I drew back from the
protecting attitude I had instinctively assumed.
His tail continued to wag, his ears drooped
lower and lower, until presently he was licking
the little kits and rooting them over with his
nose regardless of their ineffectual clawing and
spitting.</p>

<p>At this stage of the game, who should arrive
on the scene but Rebecca! She came dashing
in, having returned from a hunting excursion
to find her nest of babies gone; coming, as she
always did when anything went wrong, for our
help and comfort. As soon as she saw Bruno,
her back went up as if a spring had been
touched; she stood at bay, growling and
spitting.</p>

<p>He started towards her, but Julius grasped
his collar. Then Rebecca caught sight of her
kits. She darted to them, sprang into the box,
and covered them with her body.</p>

<p>Julius loosened his hold of Bruno, who advanced
eagerly.</p>

<p>Rebecca received him with a flash of her paw
which left a long deep scratch on his nose. He
retreated whining and growling. Julius comforted
him, while I took Rebecca in hand. For
some time we reasoned and experimented with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
them, until finally we had the satisfaction of
seeing Rebecca let down her bristles and begin
to purr while Julius smoothed her head and
back with Bruno's paw.</p>

<p>After that they kept the peace fairly well,
though Rebecca always boxed his ears when
she came in and found him licking and nosing
her kittens.</p>

<p>We tried to keep him away from them, but
he did love them so. He would watch Rebecca
out of one eye as he lay dozing, and as soon as
she started on a hunt, he would go tiptoeing to
the kitten-box for a frolic.</p>

<p>Soon they grew quite fond of playing with
his big curly ears, and forgot to spit and
scratch.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>One morning when Julius got up, he could
find only one of his slippers. After a
long search the other was found under the
edge of the washing-stand, but in a decidedly
dilapidated condition.</p>

<p>It had evidently been gnawed.</p>

<p>We gravely discussed the misfortune of having
our premises invaded by rats, and when on
the following morning one of my overshoes was
likewise discovered to be a wreck, matters began
to look serious, and Julius hastened to procure
a trap.</p>

<p>That night I was awakened from my first
doze by a sound of gnawing, and on hastily
lighting a candle, Bruno was seen with a conscious,
shamefaced expression&mdash;just like a big
boy who is caught enjoying a nursery-bottle&mdash;chewing
a shoe!</p>

<p>It was quite a revelation of dog-character to
find such a big fellow chewing up things, but
we were relieved on the score of rats. Bruno<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
was furnished with an old shoe for his very
own on which to exercise his jaws, and we
formed the habit of arranging our shoes on the
mantelpiece every night before retiring.</p>

<p>We exchanged the trap for some boxes of
tacks, which are always "handy to have in the
house."</p>

<p>About this time our neighbors, the Crows,
became possessed of a large setter dog, by name
Leo.</p>

<p>This dog was deficient in morality, and at
once developed thieving propensities.</p>

<p>Bruno soon understood that we did not want
Leo to come to our house, nor even into the
yard; still, he personally formed a dog-friendship
for him. While this seemed at the time
very strange to us, I have since explained it to
my own satisfaction.</p>

<p>I think Leo must have confided to Bruno the
fact that he was not well cared for by his
owners.</p>

<p>Many people seem to think it is unnecessary
to give a dog regular meals. They think he
ought to "pick up a living." The Crows
seemed to have this idea; so Bruno doubtless
felt that Leo was not altogether to blame for
being a thief, and after fiercely driving him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
outside of our gate, he would follow, and they
would have romps and races until both were
exhausted.</p>

<p>Leo was the only real dog-friend Bruno ever
had. All his other friends were either humans
or cats.</p>

<p>The crowds of dogs that sometimes go yelping
and tearing through the streets were to him
objects of the loftiest scorn. From front window
or porch he would look down his nose at them,
then turn, stepping high, to march off and lie
down in some remote corner where only the
faintest echoes of their din could reach him.</p>

<p>One evening, while Julius and I were at
choir-practice, we heard something that distressed
me greatly. I felt that I could not
stay, so we slipped out and hurried home. As
soon as we were inside of our own door I
threw myself into Julius's arms with childlike
sobbing.</p>

<p>He tried to comfort me, but I could only
hear my own heart-throbs. All at once he
exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look, Judith, look at Bruno!"</p>

<p>His tone was so strange, it penetrated even
my grief. I raised my head and there was
Bruno, standing upright, his head against Julius's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
shoulder, as close to me as he could get, his
eyes full of tears, the picture of woe.</p>

<p>"You see Bruno is crying too," said Julius.</p>

<p>As soon as Bruno saw me look up, he threw
back his head and wagged his tail as if to
say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come now, that's better, much better."</p>

<p>My tears still fell, but they were no longer
bitter. There was something about the sympathy
of that dumb creature which touched a
chord not to be reached by anything human. It
was so unlooked for and so sincere.</p>

<p>It was wonderful how he entered into all our
feelings. In those days I was very much
afraid of thunder-storms. In some subtle way
Bruno divined this and kept the closest watch
for clouds. If the heavens began to be overcast,
he would go from window to window,
noting developments, coming to me every few
minutes to look into my face and wag his tail
reassuringly.</p>

<p>When our fears were verified and the storm
broke, he would come to rest his head on my
knee, wincing with me at the thunders and
flashes. When the worst was over, and big
scattering drops showed the end of the storm
to be near, he would drop at my feet with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
huge sigh of relief that showed what a nervous
strain he had been enduring.</p>

<p>He also discovered a strong aversion I had
for spiders, and went about killing every one
he could find. Chancing to be at my side one
day when I dodged and exclaimed at the too
familiar dartings of a wasp that was flying
around me, he from that time made it a rule
to destroy flying bugs of all kinds, often jumping
high in the air to catch them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>Now approached a troublous time in Bruno's
career. He fell into bad ways. We
always thought it was Leo who tempted him.</p>

<p>It developed in this way. Soon after dark
Bruno would ask to have the door opened for
him to go out. He would look as innocent as
if he only meant to step around to the well for
a fresh drink. At bedtime we would suddenly
remember that we had heard nothing of him
since he had been let out. Julius would open
the door expecting to find him lying on the
porch. Disappointed in this, he would whistle,
call, whistle again, but there would be no
answer. At last we would give him up and go
to bed. At gray dawn there would be a sound
of scratching on the door, and when it was
opened Bruno would come in, muddy, draggled,
and exhausted. After drinking with evident
relish from his water-bowl, he would curl up on
his bed and sleep till noon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>We scolded him about these "tears," as we
called them, until he would in spite of his
fatigue go through with his tricks on being
admitted in the morning: he would "sit up"
and offer to "shake hands" with first one paw,
then the other; trying to propitiate whichever
of us opened the door for him. But he would
not give up the "tears." Then we tried chaining
him for the night. This kept him at home
for nearly a week, until he finally succeeded in
pulling out the staple that held the chain. In
the morning Bruno, chain, and all had vanished;
for it was summer-time and we had chained
him outside, under an open shed. The hours
crept on towards afternoon, and still he came
not. I had heard at intervals all day the distant
yelping of a dog, but had only noticed it
to suppose that a neighbor some few blocks
away had had occasion to tie up his watch-dog.
As evening approached, I anxiously awaited the
return of Julius from his office that he might go
in search of our missing Bruno.</p>

<p>While I was waiting, the milkman came
along.</p>

<p>"Where's your dog?" he asked, as he poured
out the milk.</p>

<p>Bruno and Rebecca always watched for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
milkman and were first to greet him; this day
only Rebecca was there.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew," I answered; "he ran off
in the night dragging his chain, and we don't
know what has become of him."</p>

<p>"There's a big brown dog that looks just
like yours chained to the sidewalk over yonder
beyond Mr. Black's."</p>

<p>He jerked his head in the direction whence
the yelping sounds had come.</p>

<p>Uncle Edwards was then spending a few days
with us. He was one of those people who believe
that sooner or later all dogs go mad, and
that it is as much as one's life is worth to come
within ten feet of them. He and Bruno were
on the most distant terms of mutual toleration.</p>

<p>But I was desperate. Julius had not come,
and I must be at home in case Bruno did arrive
hungry, thirsty, and footsore. There was no
help for it; I must ask assistance from Uncle
Edwards.</p>

<p>He was a gentleman of the old school, always
obliging and courteous. He would bow politely
and pick up a loaded shell with burning fuse
attached, if asked to do so by a lady.</p>

<p>He readily agreed to go round by Mr. Black's
to see if by any chance the "big brown dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
chained to the sidewalk" could be ours. He
shortly returned, leading by the extreme end of
his chain a very crestfallen Bruno; tired, hungry,
thirsty, his throat raw with ineffectual yelpings.</p>

<p>Delighted and relieved as I was to see him,
I still had room for a smothered laugh at his
and Uncle Edwards's attitude to each other as
they approached. Uncle regarded Bruno out
of the tail of his eye, as if he were some infernal
machine, liable at any moment to do things
unheard of; while Bruno, perfectly aware of
his distrust, threw tired, meekly humorous
glances out of the tail of <i>his</i> eye. It was
comical.</p>

<p>His chain had caught in a cleft board of the
sidewalk, and he had been held there, struggling
and yelping, part of the night and all day! All
who had happened to see him thought he had
been fastened there for some purpose or other.</p>

<p>This was a pretty severe lesson for Bruno,
and it kept him at home for several nights. At
last temptation again overcame him, and at bedtime
one night he was missing. When he
returned at dawn, his side was peppered with
small bloody wounds. He had been shot!</p>

<p>"That settles it," said Julius; "he has been
chasing sheep!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>We were extremely troubled at this discovery,
and Julius said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our life is too quiet for him. His instincts
are all for chasing something. Our little promenades
are but an aggravation to a dog who
is longing to stretch his legs over miles of
country."</p>

<p>We knew he must go at least six miles to
find sheep.</p>

<p>For the first time we now began seriously to
consider the idea of giving Bruno away.</p>

<p>A young hunter, whom we will call Mr.
Nimrod, had long been wanting him. He told
us it was a shame to turn such a splendid fellow
into a drawing-room dog. He would hold forth
indefinitely on Bruno's points, especially certain
extra toes on his various legs. He said a dog
with such toes was built for a "lightning-express"
runner, and that it was outraging nature
to try to keep him cooped up in a village lot.
After many discussions we at last decided we
ought to give him up to the life for which he
so evidently longed.</p>

<p>We were about to move into the house we
had been building, and we thought the best way
to make the dog-transfer would be for Julius
to take him to Mr. Nimrod's the last day before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
we moved, so that if he ran away and came
to find us, there would be only the deserted
house.</p>

<p>It did not occur to us that this would be
cruel. We knew we were giving him up for
his own good, and we felt sure he would soon
get wonted to his new home, where he could
live the life for which he was created. So, on
the last evening in the old home, Julius took
up his hat, which was always a signal to Bruno,
who came and sat up before him, with ears at
"attention," which was his way of asking,&mdash;</p>

<p>"May I go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Boonie can go," answered Julius.</p>

<p>Then Bruno, who had long since learned to
understand the difference between "go" and
"stay," went bounding down the walk, leaped
over the gate, and began rushing back and forth
along in front of the lot, giving short barks of
delight. Julius called him back, and he came
rather crestfallen, thinking he was, after all, to
"stay;" but it was only that I might hug him
and tell him, "Good-bye, you must be a good
doggie!"</p>

<p>This puzzled him; but his bewilderment was
soon forgotten in the fact that he was really and
truly to "go." When Julius returned an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
later, he told me he had slipped away while Mr.
and Mrs. Nimrod were petting Bruno, and so
had escaped a formal leave-taking. I was glad
of this, for I had dreaded their parting.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that I was the one to
attend to Bruno's wants&mdash;that he always came
to me when hungry or thirsty, and that I never
disciplined him as Julius sometimes did,&mdash;still
he showed in many ways that Julius's place in
his heart was far above mine. So I was relieved
that there had been no good-byes.</p>

<p>We were both entirely engrossed for the next
few days by getting moved and settled. In
spite of busy hands, I had many times felt a
tugging at the heart-strings for the absent
Bruno. I said nothing about it, though; and
Julius afterwards confessed that he too had
felt longings, but had suppressed them for fear
of upsetting me, just as I had concealed my
feelings on his account.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the fourth day Julius
could stand it no longer; he must have some
news of Bruno. So he looked up Mr. Nimrod.</p>

<p>Before he could ask any questions, Mr. Nimrod
began,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What did you feed that dog, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Why, the same things we ate," answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Julius, in surprise; "whatever there was on the
table."</p>

<p>"Well, he won't eat anything for us. We've
tried everything we could think of. What does
he like best?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Julius, "he likes biscuit and
toast and fried mush,&mdash;all sorts of crisp and
crackly things; and bones,&mdash;little ones that he
can bite,&mdash;and meats of course."</p>

<p>"We've tried everything except the toast
and mush. We'll try him on those. I'll go
right home now and see about it."</p>

<p>When Julius came home and repeated this
conversation to me, it produced what may
without exaggeration be called a state of mind.
I was half wild. All the emotions I had been
struggling to conceal since Bruno's departure
now held sway. Julius was deeply moved too.
We could only comfort each other by recalling
all the trouble we had had with Bruno, from
the anxious night of his first "tear," to that last
morning when he had returned wounded and
bloody.</p>

<p>We assured each other that he would soon
consent to be happy in such a good home, and
that it would be wrong for us to indulge our
feelings to his ultimate hurt. We dwelt espe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>cially
on the fact that if he should again go
sheep-chasing and be shot at, he stood at least
a chance of being fatally wounded.</p>

<p>Thus we talked ourselves into a reasonable
frame of mind.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>I knew, without anything being said about
it, that Julius would lose no time the next
day in finding out if Bruno had consented to
eat his supper. When he started down town
a whole hour earlier than usual, I knew, as well
as if he had said so, that it was in order to have
time to hunt up Mr. Nimrod before office hours.</p>

<p>"It's no use," began Mr. Nimrod, as soon as
Julius appeared; "wouldn't touch a thing.
Never saw such a dog. I believe he's trying
to starve himself."</p>

<p>"Don't you think," ventured Julius, "it
would be well to bring him out to our house
for a little visit, to cheer him up?"</p>

<p>"Not much!" answered Mr. Nimrod, promptly.
"I never could break him in then. He has run
away twice already, and both times I followed
him and found him hanging around the house
you moved from. Lucky the trail was cold.
If he once finds out where you are, the jig's
up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>When Julius came home at noon, we sat at
the table listless and dejected, now and then
making fitful attempts to converse. The dainty
noon meal had suddenly lost flavor after we
had exchanged a few sentences about "Poor,
hungry Bruno!"</p>

<p>Were we to eat, drink, and be merry, while
our faithful friend starved for love of us!</p>

<p>After Julius had returned to the office, there
was such a tugging at my heart-strings that I&mdash;well,
yes, I did, I cried! How I regretted that
I had never cultivated an intimacy with Mrs.
Nimrod, so that I might have "run in" to call,
and thus have an opportunity to comfort the
poor homesick fellow!</p>

<p>Julius saw the tear-traces when he returned
towards evening, and proposed a stroll down
town; thinking, I suppose, that if we sat at
home we should be sure to talk of Bruno and
be melancholy.</p>

<p>We walked through all the principal streets
of the town, meeting and greeting friends and
acquaintances, stopping to glance at new goods
in several of the shops; bringing up at last in
the town's largest bookstore.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 330px;">
<a id="Illo_2" name="Illo_2"></a>
<img src="images/illo_2.png" width="330" height="500" alt="I fell on my knees to hug him." title="I fell on my knees to hug him." />
<span class="caption">"I fell on my knees to hug him."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Page 25.</span></span>
</div>

<p>We were just starting for home, when on the
sidewalk there was a sudden flurry and dash,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>and Bruno, stomach to earth, was crawling about
us, uttering yelps and whines that voiced a joy
so great it could not be told from mortal agony.</p>

<p>Regardless of the fact that we were on the
most public thoroughfare of the town, I fell on
my knees to hug him, and could not keep back
tears of mingled joy and pain. His poor thin
sides! His gasps of rapture! Oh, Boonie,
Boonie!</p>

<p>The first excitement over, we looked about
us for Mr. Nimrod. He was nowhere to be
seen. Bruno had evidently escaped, and was
running away to look for us when he had
chanced to strike our trail and so had found us.</p>

<p>We were glad he was alone. We both felt
that if he had been torn from us at that supreme
moment he would have died; he was
so faint with fasting and grief, and then the
overwhelming joy at finding those he had
thought to be forever lost to him! He squeezed
himself in between us, and kept step as we went
homeward in the gathering twilight.</p>

<p>As soon as we reached home, we hurried him
to the kitchen to enjoy the sight of the poor
fellow at his trencher. How we fed him! I
ransacked the pantry for the things he liked best,
till his sides began to swell visibly. He paused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
between mouthfuls to feast his loving eyes on
first one, then the other of us, and his tail never
once stopped wagging. Rebecca came purring
in to rub against his legs, and even submitted
with shut eyes to a kiss from his big wet
tongue. He must have felt that such an hour
repaid him for all his sufferings.</p>

<p>After he had eaten until he evidently could
not take another morsel, we drew him in front
of us as we sat side by side, for a three-cornered
talk. He sat on end, waving his tail to
and fro on the floor, wrinkling his forehead and
cocking up his ears, while we explained the
situation to him.</p>

<p>We told him how kind Mr. Nimrod meant to
be to him, how he would train him to hunt and
take him on long daily runs. Then we reminded
him how impossible it was for Julius to
go on such excursions with him, and of how
many scrapes he had got into by going alone,&mdash;he
seeming to take it all in and to turn it over
in his mind.</p>

<p>Then we told him that since he had found
our new home he could come often to see us,
and he would always find us glad to see him,&mdash;yes,
more than glad!</p>

<p>Then Julius got his hat and said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>"Come on, Boonie; now we're going home."</p>

<p>He seemed quite willing to go. I told him
good-by with a heart so light I could scarcely
believe it the same one I had felt to be such a
burden when I had set off for our walk two
hours earlier. I busied myself then preparing
a little supper against Julius's return; for we
had not been able to eat since breakfast, and I
knew by my own feelings that Julius would
welcome the sight of a well-spread smoking
table; and he said on his return that I "guessed
just right."</p>

<p>He and Bruno had found the Nimrods very
much disturbed over their dog's disappearance.
Mr. Nimrod had just returned from an unsuccessful
search, and they were wondering what
to do next. They welcomed the wanderer, but
were concerned, too, that he had discovered our
dwelling-place.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we'll have to keep him tied up
now," said Mr. Nimrod.</p>

<p>Julius thought not, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now that he knows where we are, and can
come for a glimpse of us now and then, I
believe he'll be better contented than he was
when he thought we'd left the country."</p>

<p>Better contented he certainly was, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
positively refused to stay at home. It soon
came to be a regular thing for Julius to escort
him back every evening.</p>

<p>The Nimrods lived nearly a mile from us, so
Julius did not lack for exercise.</p>

<p>Mr. Nimrod finally came to remonstrate
with us.</p>

<p>"You ought to shut him out," he cried, "then
he'd have to come back home."</p>

<p>For answer, Julius showed him certain long,
deep scratches on our handsome new doors,
adding,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't you see? It's as much as our doors
are worth to shut him out, and he leaps that
four-foot fence as if it were but four inches."</p>

<p>There was obviously no possible reply to such
logic as this; so he continued to come,&mdash;dragging
sometimes a rope or strap, or some other
variety of tether, triumphantly proving that
love laughs at locksmiths!</p>

<p>The Nimrods at last lost heart. Bruno never
would eat there, and he never stayed when he
could manage to escape. One night it was
raining hard when the time came for him to be
taken "home," so they did not go; and that
seemed to settle it.</p>

<p>He was our dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>We had given him away without his consent,
and he refused to be given; so the trade was
off. He stayed closely at home now, seeming
to think we might disappear again if he did not
watch us.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>Unless there were guests in the house, we
usually slept with all the inner doors wide
open for better circulation of air.</p>

<p>One night we were awakened by tremendous
barkings and growlings from Bruno. Julius
spoke to him, and he answered with a whine.
Then we could hear his feet pad-padding on the
carpet as he went from our room, tap-tapping
on the oil-cloth in the hall, pad-padding again
through the sitting-room and the dining-room,
then tap-tapping on the painted kitchen floor,
with more loud barks and deep growls.</p>

<p>Julius tried again to quiet him, but he refused
to be quieted.</p>

<p>"Something disturbs him," I said. "Maybe
we'd better let him out."</p>

<p>"No," said Julius, "it is probably that
wretched Leo lurking around, trying to toll
him off. He's better inside."</p>

<p>I did not think he would seem so fierce if it
were Leo, but I was too sleepy to argue; so we
dozed off, leaving him still on the alert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>Deep was our surprise next morning to find
that a band of thieves had raided the town
during the night, and that the houses on both
sides of us had been entered! How we petted
and praised Bruno, our defender! He was
quite unconcerned, though, and seemed as if he
would say to us,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, that was nothing. I only barked and
made a racket!"</p>

<p>Truly, it was only necessary for him to bark
and make a racket. There was never any occasion
for him to go further. His voice was so
loud and deep it always conveyed the impression
of a dog as big as a house,&mdash;one that
could swallow a man at one mouthful without
winking.</p>

<p>People were always ready to take the hint
when he gave voice to his emotions. They
never undertook to argue with him.</p>

<p>After that night we never slept with such
comfortable feelings of perfect security as we
felt at those times when we were half aroused
by Bruno's barks and growls.</p>

<p>For a while the days passed uneventfully in
our little home. Julius and I were interested
in beautifying and improving our grounds, so
time never dragged with us. Rebecca rejoiced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
in several successive sets of kittens. They and
Bruno frolicked through the days, with exciting
interruptions in the shape of the milkman's
calls, Julius's returns from the office, and occasional
visits from the neighbors' children.</p>

<p>For greater convenience we always spoke
collectively of Bruno, Rebecca and her kits, as
"the cattle."</p>

<p>The milkman's daily calls never grew stale
to them. They generally heard his bell before
Julius or I suspected he was near, and would
all go to the sidewalk to meet him. Bruno
would leap the fence; Rebecca and her kits
would creep through. As soon as the milk was
poured out, they all raced to the back piazza to
wait for their share of it. When the dish was
filled and placed before them on the floor, Bruno
stood back with drooping ears, watching them
drink. He seemed to feel that it would not be
fair to pit his great flap of a tongue against
their tiny rose-leaves. They always left some
for him, which he devoured in two or three
laps, while they all sat about washing their
faces. I don't think he cared for the milk; he
took it to be sociable, and seemed to be as well
satisfied with a swallow or two as he was after
drinking the dishful I sometimes offered him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
He often tried to chew the grain on which the
chickens were fed, and would eat anything he
saw us taking, including all kinds of fruit, nuts,
candies, and ices. Of course the chief of his
diet was the various preparations of cereals and
meats, but he seemed to want a taste of all that
was going.</p>

<p>Once, much to his own ultimate disgust, he
coaxed me to give him a sniff of a smelling-bottle
he thought I seemed to be enjoying.
After that, he regarded all bottles with the
deepest suspicion and aversion.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>It is hard to remember just when we first began
to talk Florida. Then a neighbor went
down there on a prospecting tour, and returned
bringing enthusiastic accounts of the climate
and opportunities. We were greatly interested,
and at once sent off for various Florida papers,
pamphlets, and books.</p>

<p>Julius had always dreaded the bleak northern
winters, having some chronic troubles,&mdash;a
legacy of the Civil War. It is only in literature
that a delicate man is interesting; practically,
it subjects him to endless trials and humiliations,
so we never gave his state of health as a
reason for the proposed change. Instead, we
flourished my tender throat. A woman may be
an invalid without loss of prestige, so not one
of our friends suspected that our proposed
change of climate was not solely on my account.</p>

<p>We decided that as soon as our northern
property could be disposed of, we would turn
our faces southward and try pioneering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>Some children in a neighboring family had
formed an enthusiastic friendship with Bruno,
and as soon as our plans were announced, their
parents asked us to give him to them when we
were ready to start South. In spite of our
former experience in giving him away, this
seemed entirely feasible to us.</p>

<p>In the first place, we thought it would be
utterly impossible to take him with us to
Florida. Then he was really and truly attached
to the children who wanted him; so we readily
consented; and we encouraged them to monopolize
him as much as possible, so that we might
see him comfortably settled before we started.
They lived next door to us, and Bruno was
always ready to join them in a game of romps.
He even ate from their hands. It seemed a
perfect arrangement.</p>

<p>Our pretty little home was soon sold and dismantled,
and we went to board in another part
of town while preparing for the long journey,
which then seemed almost as difficult as a trip
to the moon. We locked up the empty house
and slipped away to our boarding-place, while
Bruno, all unconscious of what was going on,
was barking and tearing about in a game of tag on
the other side of our neighbor's large grounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>Old Aunt Nancy, a colored woman who had
belonged to one of my aunts before the war,
and who had been our stand-by in domestic
emergencies, had taken Rebecca and her family,
promising them "Jes' as good a home as I can
gib'm, Miss Judith." It was a sad breaking
up, but we felt that our pets were well provided
for, and that we should feel worse for leaving
them than they would at being left.</p>

<p>Vain thought!</p>

<p>Two evenings after leaving our home, while
I was busy in our room, making ready to begin
packing, I heard Julius's step on the stairs,
accompanied by a familiar clatter that made my
heart stand still. The door burst open, and,
before I could rise from my kneeling position,
surrounded by piles of folded things, I was
knocked over sideways by a rapturous onslaught
from Bruno.</p>

<p>"What does this mean!" I exclaimed, as
soon as I could speak.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Julius. "I found
him waiting for me at the office door when I
came out. He seemed half wild with delight
at seeing me again. I rather think it is a repetition
of the Nimrod experiment."</p>

<p>"Poor old fellow!" I cried. "See how his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
sides have fallen in just in these two days! He
has been starving again, and we have nothing
to give him!"</p>

<p>"That's so," said Julius. "I'd better go
and get something for him, hadn't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," I answered. "At once, poor
old doggie!"</p>

<p>So they went clattering down the stairs again,
and soon returned with some promising-looking
paper bags.</p>

<p>We spread a newspaper on the hearth to receive
his feast, then sat watching him and returning
his glances of affection while he ate.
When he had eaten to his satisfaction and
dropped into a happy snooze, Julius said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I might as well try to find
out if it would be possible to take him with
us. I'll see the agent to-morrow. We must
either take him, or have him killed; for I see
plainly that it won't do at all to try to leave
him."</p>

<p>"If we could just have him go along in the
car with us, it would be all right," answered I.
"He is such a knowing old fellow he would
understand things perfectly."</p>

<p>"That's impossible, I know," cried Julius.
"If he goes at all, he must ride in baggage-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>cars,
and we'll be in a sleeper. I don't see
how we can manage it."</p>

<p>I began to think that a way would open, and
my heart felt lighter than it had at any time
since we first began to talk Florida. If we
could have Bruno with us, I no longer dreaded
going to a land which, in my imaginings, had
appeared to be teeming with unknown dangers.</p>

<p>The next morning Julius went promptly to
interview the agent, and found that, after all,
it would be possible to take Bruno with us to
Florida. It would be some trouble and some
expense. Besides his passage as baggage, the
porters in each car must be feed; and while we
in the sleeper should be in a through car, he
would have a number of changes to make,&mdash;one
of them at early dawn, and another in the
night. It would be necessary for Julius to see
to these changes in person, in case Bruno proved
to be unruly, which was quite probable. We
decided to undertake it, and Bruno's outfit for
the journey was at once purchased. This consisted
of a strong new collar and chain, with a
big tin cup fastened to the chain for plenty of
drinks, and a lunch-basket full of biscuit.</p>

<p>The memorable day came, and we were
escorted to the train by kind neighbors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
friends full of good-byes and good wishes for
us all, Bruno receiving a full share of their
attentions.</p>

<p>We knew well that they considered the whole
affair to be a wild-goose chase, and that they
expected to see us return, sadder and wiser, in
a year at furthest.</p>

<p>As soon as the train was under way, Julius
went forward to see how Bruno was taking it.
He found him in a state of the utmost excitement,
howling and dragging at his chain, probably
remembering his other journey on the cars,
when he had left his first home to come alone to
us in his puppyhood. When he saw Julius
and realized that we were with him, his joy and
relief were touching. Julius stayed awhile with
him, and got him some water,&mdash;he was always
thirsty after "crying,"&mdash;then came back to
report to me.</p>

<p>I felt so relieved to know that we had really
got off with Bruno in good shape, it almost
made me forget a small ache in the corner of
my heart for something that had happened a
day or two before. I had gone up by the old
home to say good-by to an invalid neighbor,
and there, on the sidewalk, by the gate, sat
Rebecca. Thin, scrawny, and alert, she sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
watching for somebody,&mdash;easy to guess what
"somebody." How glad she was to see me!</p>

<p>I sat down on the gate-step, and took her in
my arms, wishing with all my heart that we
could take her with us too. Still, I knew we
couldn't. She, a sober, middle-aged cat, to be
carried all those many miles! Then it might
be weeks after we reached Florida before we
decided where to settle. A dog, once there,
could trot around after us, but what could we
do with a cat? She had never learned to follow
for any distance, and she was always nervous
about being carried.</p>

<p>No, it wasn't to be thought of.</p>

<p>I stayed, petting her as long as I could; then,
after urging her to go back and be contented
with Aunt Nancy, I bade her a tearful good-by,
and carried away an ache in my heart that
I sometimes feel yet.</p>

<p>Dear old Rebecca!</p>

<p>Some day I hope to go across into cat-heaven
and hunt her up. Then she can be made to
understand why I was seemingly so hard-hearted
as to go off and leave her looking
mournfully after me on that sad day so long
ago. Maybe she knows now; I hope she does.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>It was late forenoon when we set off Florida-ward.
Just after dark we reached a big
city where we were to take the through sleeper
to Jacksonville. In those days there was no
Union Depot there, and it was necessary to cross
the city in order to get started on the road
South.</p>

<p>This transfer had worried us all along, for
the time was limited, and there was all our
baggage to see to and recheck, and Bruno.
We arranged that I was to take Bruno and go
with him in the regular transfer omnibus, while
Julius crossed with the baggage. We thought
that Bruno and I could take care of each other,
though I confess I was not willing to have a
private cab. In the well-lighted, comfortably
filled 'bus I felt safe enough, even though I
was crossing a strange city at nightfall, with
only a dog for escort.</p>

<p>Bruno looked wistfully at the door as the
'bus started, but seemed satisfied when I assured
him it was all right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Julius was waiting for us at the other station
with tickets and checks.</p>

<p>When he returned from escorting Bruno to
the baggage car, reporting, "All's well," we
both fairly laughed, in the relief of having
passed the most puzzling part of the journey.</p>

<p>I did not see Bruno again until the next
morning. It was gray dawn. The train was
standing, puffing and snorting like a restless
horse, on the track under the shadow of Lookout
Mountain.</p>

<p>On inquiry, Julius had learned that there
would be a delay of a quarter of an hour or so
there, and, as he had to be up, anyway, to
transfer Bruno to another baggage car, he had
planned to give him a little run; so, as I leaned
out of the car window, I saw Julius with
Bruno's chain, cup, etc., bunched in his hands,
while the happy dog was galloping up and down
the roadside. He performed leaps and antics
expressive of extreme joy when I leaned out
and called to him, saying to me as plainly as
possible,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here we are again! Isn't it jolly?"</p>

<p>And I assured him that it was.</p>

<p>After that glimpse I saw no more of Bruno
till we reached Jacksonville; but Julius re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>ported,
from time to time, that he seemed to
comprehend the meaning of our plan of travel,
and trotted along from old to new baggage car,
so eager not to be left that he tried to enter
every one he came to with doors standing open.</p>

<p>Early on the next morning after our stop by
Lookout Mountain, we entered the "Florida
Metropolis." And now, behold, a great surprise!
We had brought thinner clothing in
our hand-bags, thinking that, as we journeyed
southward, our heavy garments, built for northern
winters, would prove to be oppressive. How
startling, then, to feel our features pinched by
nipping breezes as we stepped from the cars at
last in the Sunny South! True, as we passed
residences on our way to the hotel, we saw
green trees and blooming flowers; but where
were the balmy airs that in our dreams were
always fanning the fadeless flowers in this
Mecca of our hopes?</p>

<p>After leaving the cars, the most welcome
sight that greeted our eager eyes was a roaring
open fire in the hotel reception-room. We
thought this a most excellent joke. They were
very good to Bruno (for a consideration) at the
hotel, but it was against their rules to allow
dogs in the rooms, so he was installed in com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>fortable
quarters outside. Julius went with
him to make sure he was satisfied, and to see
that he was watered, fed, and in good spirits
before we had our own breakfast. On the way
down, as ever before, Bruno had attracted much
favorable notice. Women and girls exclaimed,
"Oh, see that lovely dog!" And a number
of men scraped acquaintance with Julius by
admiring notice of his "Mighty fine dog!"</p>

<p>Bruno shrank from their attentions. He
never made friends with strangers, no matter
how much they tried to pet him; and he never
ate anything offered to him by others unless we
told him to. In fact, he was always very particular
about appropriating food. Sometimes at
home, when in a brown study, I placed his dish
of food on the floor without saying anything;
but he would never begin to eat until he had
gained my attention by thrusting his nose into
my hand, asking, "Is that mine?" by questioning
glances directed from me to the dish; then,
when I answered, "Yes; that's Boonie's; that's
for Boonie," he would fall to and enjoy it.</p>

<p>We were glad of this trait; and we often
thought that but for it he would, very early
in his career, have fallen a victim to poison, for
he was greatly feared by many timid people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
especially by various grocer and butcher boys,
who approached our premises with so many
absurd precautions that it seemed to afford
Bruno the greatest delight to keep them in a
state of terror.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>We made but a short stay in Jacksonville,
then hurried on to St. Augustine,
where a former acquaintance of Julius's was
living with his family. We had to take a river
steamer to Tocoi,&mdash;called Decoy by many, for
obvious reasons,&mdash;then journey across to the
coast on a tiny railway.</p>

<p>The steamboat on the St. John's was a first
experience of the kind for Bruno, who seemed
to enjoy it greatly, for the boat had but few
passengers beside ourselves, and we went up
and down stairs at will, making him several
visits in his quarters on the lower deck.</p>

<p>Things were even more informal on the little
railway. There was no one about when we
boarded the train; so Bruno followed us into the
passenger coach, crept under the seat, doubling
himself up like a shut knife, and, totally effaced
by the time the conductor came around, rode
first-class for once. It seemed such a treat for
us all to be together as we journeyed, that our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
short ride across from "Decoy" to the coast
stands out in memory as the pleasantest part of
the journey.</p>

<p>We were met at St. Augustine by Julius's
friend, and, as he bore a pressing invitation for
us from his family, we stopped that first day
with them, so that they might have their fill of
news from their friends and relatives whom we
had seen just before starting to Florida.</p>

<p>They kindly urged us to stay longer, but we
thought that two people and a dog made a
formidable party to entertain as visitors; so we
hunted up a pleasant boarding-house, and settled
ourselves for a two weeks' stay.</p>

<p>All three of us found much to surprise us in
the old town; but by far the greatest sensation
was Bruno's when we first took him out for a
run, and he promptly made a dash into one of
the creeks as the tide was flowing in, and took
a big drink. He was warm with running, and
the water looked so inviting that he had taken
a number of swallows before he tasted it. Then
his antics were most comical. He snorted and
shook his head till his ears flapped again, and
rubbed at his nose, first with one paw and then
with the other. After that one lesson he never
again drank from a strange pool or stream with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>out
first tasting it very gingerly, then waiting
a few seconds to make sure of the after-taste.
But if he objected to the taste of salt water, he
found no flaw in the feeling of it.</p>

<p>There is no memory of him on which I so
much love to dwell as on the picture he made
with his tawny curls streaming backwards in
the breakers when we took him out to the beach.
The green-curling, foam-tipped waves were to
him a perfect delight. Even his dashing out in
our midst and shaking himself so that we were
all drenched in an impromptu shower-bath is
pleasant,&mdash;as a memory,&mdash;though at the time
we scolded him, and tried to respond sternly to
his waggish glances, as he gambolled about and
rolled in the sand.</p>

<p>The salt water was new to all of us, so we
spent as much time as possible on the island
and the beaches.</p>

<p>On those days when we were confined to the
mainland by showers, or by the business we
were attending to between times, we used to
go, towards evening, to promenade on the seawall.
Then Bruno always got down in one of
the basins for a swim before we returned to our
temporary home.</p>

<p>Although it seemed like northern spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
weather, some days being quite chilly, and
others warm enough for summer clothes, we
awoke one morning to the fact that to-morrow
would be Christmas. It had seemed to us,
since our arrival in St. Augustine, as if we
were in a foreign country, the Spanish element
was so large in proportion to the rest of the
town, both in the people and their customs and
in the arrangement and the construction of the
city. We heard of the celebration of midnight
Mass in the old Cathedral, and resolved to
"assist;" but, as the evening came on crisp
and chilly, our enthusiasm cooled with it. The
tonic qualities of the unaccustomed salt air had
inspired us with a keen interest in food and
sleep; so, after fully deciding to sit up for the
Mass, we were ready by half-past nine to declare
that there was not a sight in the world worth
the sacrifice of such a night's sleep as that for
which we felt ready. So we embarked for
dreamland, whence we were recalled at daylight
by Bruno's excitement over a perfect din of tin
trumpets and toy drums.</p>

<p>As we dressed, we peeped through the blinds
at the processions of small boys marching by in
the narrow streets below, blowing trumpets and
pounding drums. The daily drills at the bar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>racks
in the old city made all the small boys of
the town even more ambitious than small boys
usually are to be soldiers. Apparently, every
one of them had sent Santa Claus a petition
to bring him something warlike for a Christmas
present.</p>

<p>Julius delighted Bruno by taking him out
and buying him a paper of candy, which he ate
with much relish; then we three sat on the
upper piazza on which our room opened, listening
to the music and watching the processions.</p>

<p>It was a very strange Christmas to all three
of us. The air was pleasantly warm, and
green things, with roses and other flowers, were
in sight in all directions.</p>

<p>As soon as Christmas had passed, we, with
that feeling of having turned a corner, common
at such times, began to hasten our preparations
to go on South. We had inspected various
tracts of land around St. Augustine, but had
not found anything to which we felt particularly
drawn. It seemed rather odd, too, to
come South intending to pioneer, and then to
settle in or near what the old sergeant at the
Fort assured us was the oldest city in the Union.</p>

<p>We felt that we must, at all events, see what
the wilder parts of the State were like before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
deciding; so we soon found ourselves speeding
away again towards "Decoy," to catch the boat
for a little station away down South, up the
river, which was then the only route to a small
settlement in the mid-lake country, where a
relative was living, who had urged us to see
his part of Florida before deciding on anything.</p>

<p>It seems odd now to think how remote south
middle Florida was in those days. The point
we were then trying to reach is now less than
twelve hours from Jacksonville by rail. Then
we travelled all night by boat, and took train
at breakfast-time across to a big lake, where a
tiny steamer awaited us; on this we crossed the
lake, then stopped at a town on the other side,
to wait for a wagon which was to come a half-day's
journey to meet us.</p>

<p>Our message was delayed, so we spent two
days at an English inn, near the big lake, where
we made some friends we have kept on our list
ever since. And besides these friendships, we
have treasured many pleasant memories of this
inn. We approached it in the twilight of a
chilly, blustering day, and on entering it we
were greeted by an immense open fire of light-wood,
which glorified the polished floor, strewn
with the skins of wild creatures killed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
near-by thickets, called hammocks or hummocks.
The firelight gave fitful glimpses of
old-fashioned chairs, tables, etc., and lighted
up a number of large gilt-framed paintings
which adorned the walls;&mdash;in short, it was a
complete picture of artistic comfort. Nor was
our satisfaction lessened by the fragrant odor of
frying ham and hot muffins, wafted to us as we
crossed the hall.</p>

<p>They gave us a ground-floor room in an L
opening on one of the side piazzas. This
arrangement suited Bruno perfectly, and therefore
it pleased us. There was a small lake
behind the house, and the next day Julius proposed
a row. The boat was quite small, and
he was then rather unskilled in the use of oars;
so we coaxed Bruno to sit on the tiny wharf
and see us go by.</p>

<p>He seemed quite willing; so we pushed off.
As we floated outward, Bruno lost heart. It
was too much like being left behind; so he
whined and plunged in after us.</p>

<p>"It isn't far across," said Julius, "and a
swim won't hurt him!"</p>

<p>So we went on, letting him follow.</p>

<p>Suddenly he gave a strange cry, and Julius
looked around, exclaiming,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>"See, he's cramping!"</p>

<p>We went to him as rapidly as possible, and
were just in time. At the risk of upsetting us
all in the deepest part of the lake&mdash;probably
about fifteen feet&mdash;Julius dragged him into the
boat. We then hurried back to the landing,
where poor Bruno had to be helped out, and we
laid him on the grass in a state of exhaustion
which alarmed us greatly.</p>

<p>It was some hours before he was himself
again, and many months before he lost a great
fear of the water,&mdash;in fact, he was never afterwards
the fearless water-dog of his youth.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p>I see us next at the little inland settlement
surrounding two small lakes for which
we had started.</p>

<p>It had been long years since we had seen the
relative who was living there, and childish
memories did not tell us that he was the most
visionary and unpractical of men. We could
not trust our own judgment in such a topsy-turvy
country as Florida, where the conditions
were all so new to us; so it is no wonder that
we took his word for a number of wild statements
and decided to buy and settle there. We
bought a tract of land from a friend and client
of his, who offered us the use of a small homestead
shanty near our land, to live in while we
were building. This shanty looked decidedly
uninviting, but the alternative was a room in
the house of our relative, a full mile away from
our place; so we decided in favor of the shanty.
It was built of rived boards, slabs split out of
the native logs. It had one door and no win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>dows.
In fact, it needed none; for the boards
lapped roughly on each other, leaving cracks
like those in window-blinds, so we could put
our fingers through the walls almost anywhere.
Besides affording a means of light and ventilation,
this was vastly convenient for various
flying and creeping things. The floor was of
rough ten-inch boards, with inch-wide cracks
between them. Julius escorted me over to inspect
it, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If we try to live in this excuse for a house,
we shall be pioneering with a vengeance."</p>

<p>After a searching glance around the premises,
I answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The pioneering is all right, if we can just
make it clean."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's easy enough!" exclaimed Julius,
in a relieved tone. "If you think we can stand
its other short-comings, I can whitewash the
whole thing, and make it so fresh and sweet
you won't know it."</p>

<p>We sent a message for our freight, which we
had left at Jacksonville, and Julius took a team
to the nearest town to buy a few necessaries.
We had brought no furniture South with us,
knowing that what we had in our Northern
home would be unsuitable for pioneering. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
freight, therefore, was mostly books and pictures,
with a few boxes of clothes, bedding, etc.
The shanty was wonderfully improved by a coat
or two of whitewash, and after an old tapestry
carpet had been put down to cover the cracks
in the floor, extending up on the walls to form
a dado, it began to look quite livable.</p>

<p>The bed and a row of trunks filled one end,
there being just room to squeeze in between
them. At the foot of the bed was a table, used
by turns as kitchen, dining, and library table;
there was also a box holding a kerosene stove,
with shelves above it for dishes and supplies.</p>

<p>We had two wooden chairs, and a bench
which we put to various uses. When these
things were all in place, and our books arranged
on boards which were laid across the rafters
overhead, we felt as snug as was Robinson
Crusoe in his cave.</p>

<p>As soon as we were comfortable, Julius got a
man to help him, and began to improve our
land. A few of the large pine-trees had to be
felled, and this performance filled Bruno with
the wildest excitement. His natural instincts
told him there was only one reason for which a
tree should ever be cut,&mdash;to capture some wild
creature which had taken refuge in its top. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the first blow of the axe he would begin to yelp
and dance, breaking into still wilder antics
when the tree began to sway and stagger, finally
rushing into the top as it fell, in a state of
excitement that bordered on frenzy.</p>

<p>As he, of course, found nothing there, he
seemed to think he had not been quick enough,
and that the creature had escaped; so he became
more and more reckless, until Julius was
alarmed for his safety, and said I must keep
him shut in-doors till the trees were down, or
he would surely end by being crushed.</p>

<p>I had my hands full. I would coax him in,
and shut the door. As soon as he heard the
chopping begin, he would whine and bark,
coaxing to be let out. I always temporized
until I heard the tree falling, then off he would
dash, and bounce into its top to yelp and
explore.</p>

<p>He never found anything in the trees, but he
never grew discouraged. He "assisted" at the
felling of every one.</p>

<p>Bruno was much happier in Florida than he
had been in our Northern home. He had all
the woods to stretch his legs in, and for
amusement he had the different kinds of wild
creatures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>One moonlight night we three had walked
over to the post-office for the mail. As Julius
and I were slowly sauntering homeward, enjoying
the night air, while Bruno made little excursions
in all directions, he suddenly came up in
front of us, and paused in that questioning way
which showed he had found something of which
he was not quite sure.</p>

<p>"What is it, Boonie?" asked Julius.</p>

<p>Bruno made a short run, then came back,
pausing as before, and glancing first in the
direction he had started to go, then at Julius.</p>

<p>"It is probably a 'possum," I suggested.</p>

<p>Bruno had shown himself to be very careful
about attacking strange animals. He seemed
to remember our adventure with the hens, his
first meeting with Rebecca, and some of his
other experiences.</p>

<p>Julius answered his evident question with,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes. It's Boonie's 'possum. Go get him!"</p>

<p>Off he sprang, dashing into a little clump of
trees, about a bow-shot from us, then with a
yelp retreated, throwing himself on the ground,
uttering short cries, rubbing and rooting his
nose down into the grass and sand. Alas, poor
Bruno! We knew what it was. We did not
see it, we did not hear it, but we knew. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
felt that he had been a victim of misplaced confidence;
but we suffered with him, for it was
days before he got rid of the "bouquet." Then
it was as if by an inspiration. He seemed, all
at once, to remember something. There was a
tiny lake near our place, that was going dry.
Day by day its waters had receded, until it
was a mere mud-hole. Bruno went down to it,
and buried himself up to the eyes in the black
mud.</p>

<p>He lay there until late afternoon, then trotted
off to a wet lake near by, and took a thorough
bath. With this, he regained his lost self-respect,
but he never forgot the experience. It
was only necessary to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Kitty, kitty, where's kitty?" to make his
ears and tail droop in the most dejected manner;
then he would creep away, out of sight, till
some more agreeable topic of conversation was
broached.</p>

<p>It was not strange, after such a trying adventure,
that Bruno was rather timid about approaching
"Br'er 'Possum" when he did meet
him. One night, he was found lurking around
outside, sniffing some odds and ends that Bruno
had disdained. After a little urging, Bruno
was induced to seize him. Finding that noth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>ing
unpleasant followed, he became from that
moment an enthusiastic 'possum-hunter, and
used to bring one in every night or two. I
usually cooked them for him, and he ate them
with a relish, which we thought was fortunate,
as we were about twelve miles from a butcher.
Another substitute for beef we found in the
Florida gopher. This is a grass-eating tortoise,
which digs a house for itself in the sand.</p>

<p>Bruno soon became a most ardent gopher-hunter.
Their hard shells make them difficult
to handle, as they promptly draw in the head
and legs on being approached; so Bruno would
nose one over until he could seize the shovel, a
protruding piece of the lower shell. Getting
this small bit between his side-teeth, he balanced
the weight by holding his head stiffly sideways,
and came trotting in. The shadow of the house
reached, he dropped the gopher, carefully turning
it over on its back, and lay down beside it,
to cool off and rest. Then off he would go for
another.</p>

<p>He kept this up day after day, sometimes
having as many as a dozen around the place
at once. As often as the creatures managed to
flop over so they could use their feet again
and start to escape, Bruno, yelping and bark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>ing,
brought them back, and turned them on
their backs.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when he returned after a protracted
hunt, bringing in a fresh victim, he
found several of them escaping at once. Then
he would hurriedly drop his latest catch, to
speed away, tracking the truants until they
were all found and recaptured, to be brought
back and nosed over again.</p>

<p>He never wearied of this sport, and after our
house was finished, and a well-stocked "chicken-park"
was added to our estate, we bought a
large camp-kettle, which we arranged on bricks
in a secluded place; in this we would heat
water and cook Bruno's gophers, so that he
and the hens had constant feasts of them and
throve apace.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>Julius and I always like to experiment
with new articles of food. We have no
sympathy with the kind of fussiness that travels
around the world with its own lunch-box, disdaining
everything strange or new. It is to us
part of the charm of changed surroundings to
test the native articles of diet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 337px;">

<span class="caption">He was hissing at Bruno.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Page 62.</span></span>
</div>

<p>We had tried roast 'possum and stewed
gopher; we now began to long for a taste of
alligator steak. We had heard that to be at
all eatable the steak must be taken from the
fleshy part of the tail of a young animal before
the creature grows large enough to lose its
shiny skin; so we were quite delighted one day
when we found that Bruno had cornered a
young one about four feet long. It was in a
little glade about three hundred yards from the
house; and as soon as Julius found the cause
of Bruno's excitement, he hurried to the house
for the axe, and soon put a stop to the creature's
demonstrations. He was hissing at Bruno like
a whole flock of geese, the while snapping at
him with his teeth and striking at him with
his tail, which he had a most astonishing way
of flourishing around.</p>

<p>When the steak was cut the meat looked
white and fine-grained, like the more delicate
kinds of fish. When cooked it was very inviting,
being a compromise between fish and the
white meat of domestic fowls.</p>

<p>We enjoyed it very much and were loud in
our praises of alligator steak, but&mdash;we didn't
want any more!</p>

<p>I cooked the rest of it for Bruno, and he ate
one more meal of it; then he struck. We
have since heard that most people who try
alligator steak have the same experience. A
first meal is thoroughly enjoyed, but one not
brought up on such a diet never gets beyond the
second. It is a useful article of food in southern
camp-life, because it makes the campers go back
to bacon and beans with renewed relish. The
same may be said of roast 'possum and stewed
gopher,&mdash;that is, for the human campers.</p>

<p>Just before our house was ready for us, while
we were still living in the little shanty, I noticed
one night when Julius came in that he was
empty-handed. He had been in the habit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a><br /><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
bringing his tools home every evening; so I
asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What have you done with the saws and
things?"</p>

<p>"I left them under the building," he answered,
"wrapped in an old coat I had there. They
will be perfectly safe, and I am tired of carrying
them."</p>

<p>I was always glad when he had discovered
an easier way of doing things; so I made no
objection to this, and went on preparing the
evening meal, for which we three were ready.
Bruno had been over at the new house all the
afternoon; so I waited on him first, seeing that
his water-basin was full to the brim and heaping
a plate with food for him. Then Julius and I
sat down with keenest enjoyment to such a
meal as we would have scorned in our old home,
but which our open-air life in the pine-woods
made exceedingly welcome. Afterwards I
cleared the table, and we sat down to our
usual evening of reading, interrupted with
occasional snatches of conversation.</p>

<p>Bruno lay at our feet&mdash;dozing when we
were quiet, thumping the floor with his tail
whenever we spoke. Towards nine o'clock he
got up, shook himself, sighed deeply, then asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
me in his usual manner to open the door for
him. This was the way he asked. He rested
his head on my knee until I looked up from
my book. Then his tail began to wag, and he
glanced quickly from me to the door, then
back at me again. I asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Boonie want to go?"</p>

<p>At this his tail wagged faster than ever, and
he went to the door and stood waiting. Julius
got up and opened the door for him; standing
for a few moments after Bruno had disappeared
in the darkness, looking at the stars and listening
to that sweet sound the pine-needles make
when the wind blows through them.</p>

<p>The night was rather cool, and it was not
long before we both began to feel sleepy.
Bruno had not returned; so Julius went to the
door, whistling and calling to him.</p>

<p>But there was no answer.</p>

<p>We waited a little while; then Julius said:</p>

<p>"He will probably be here by the time we
are ready to put out the lamp; so let's to bed."</p>

<p>I felt troubled. It reminded me of the old
days in Bruno's giddy youth when he was off
sheep-chasing. As I brushed out my hair, I
was turning over in my mind all those vague
fears I had felt when I had formerly dreamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
of Florida as a country full of unknown dangers.
At last I spoke,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Julius, do you think a big alligator could
have caught Bruno?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Julius, slowly.</p>

<p>Then I knew that he was worried too.</p>

<p>When the lamp was out, Julius went to the
door again and stood for some minutes whistling,
calling, and listening; but no sound came except
the pine murmurs and the mournful notes of a
distant "Whip-Will's-Widow."</p>

<p>It was impossible for us to sleep. Having
always had Bruno at our bedside, we had
never before felt uneasy, and had provided no
way to lock our shanty. There was just an
old-fashioned string-latch with a padlock outside;
and here we were, deserted by our protector!</p>

<p>Again and again through the night Julius
got up to call and listen.</p>

<p>Towards dawn we both slept heavily, worn
out with anxious surmises. We were awakened
by a well-known whining and scratching
at the door, and when we both sprang up to
open it, in walked Bruno, looking just as he
usually did in the morning,&mdash;lively, glad to see
us awake, and ready for his breakfast.</p>

<p>We gave him a welcome so warm it sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>prised
and delighted him, while we vainly
questioned him for an explanation of his desertion
of us for the night. It was of no use.
We could see that he had not been running,
but where <i>had</i> he been? We gave it up.</p>

<p>Julius said his troubled night had left him
without much appetite for work; but the man
who was helping him would be there, so he
thought it best to go over to the building,
anyway.</p>

<p>He surprised me by returning almost immediately.
His face was lighted up and his eyes
were dancing.</p>

<p>"I came back to tell you where Bruno slept
last night," he exclaimed. "You can't guess!"</p>

<p>"No," I answered; "I have already given
it up."</p>

<p>"He went back to watch those tools I left
over at the building. He dug himself a nest
right beside them, drawing the edge of my old
coat around for his pillow. The prints are all
there as plain as can be!"</p>

<p>We were amazed and delighted at this performance;
the reasoning seemed so human.
He had watched Julius arranging and leaving
the tools, the while making up his own mind
that it was an unwise thing to do, and evi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>dently
deciding to see to it later. His sitting
with us till bedtime, keeping in mind his
mental appointment, and then going forth without
a word from any one to keep it, seemed to
us to be a truly wonderful thing, and so it
seems to me yet.</p>

<p>From the first, we had made a constant companion
of Bruno, talking to him always as if
he could speak our language; and we have
since thought that this must have been a sort
of education for him, drawing out and developing
his own natural gifts of thought and reason.
He often surprised us by joining in the conversation.
He would be lying dozing, and we
talking in our usual tones. If we mentioned
Robbie or Charlie, the two children who were
his friends in his puppy days before he was our
dog, or spoke of Leo, or of going somewhere,
he would spring up all alert, running to the
door or window, and then to us, whining and
giving short barks of inquiry or impatience.</p>

<p>Always, after that first time we had tried to
give him away, he was subject to terrible nightmares.
In his sleep he would whimper and
sigh in a manner strangely like human sobbing.
We thought at such times that he was going
through those trying days again, in his dreams.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
So we always wakened him, petting and soothing
him till he fully realized that it was only a
dream.</p>

<p>He had other ways which we thought noteworthy.
Although he loved Julius better than
he did me, yet he always came to me with his
requests. If hungry or thirsty, he would come
to me wagging his tail and licking his lips.</p>

<p>Like "Polly," his general term for food was
cracker. If I asked, "Boonie want a cracker?"
and if it was hunger, he would yawn in a
pleased, self-conscious manner, and run towards
the place where he knew the food was kept. If
I had misunderstood his request, he continued
gazing at me, licking his lips and wagging his
tail till I asked, "Boonie want a drink?" Then
he would yawn and run towards his water-cup,
which I would find to be empty.</p>

<p>Often, when he had made his wants known
to me, I passed them on to Julius, who would
wait on him; but it made no difference: the
next time he came to me just the same. He
seemed to have reasoned it out that I was the
loaf-giver, as the old Saxons had it, or else he
felt that I was quicker to enter into his feelings
and understand his wishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>Not long after Bruno's self-imposed night
watch we found ourselves settled on
our own estate, ready to carry out our plans for
the future. Briefly they were as follows. We
had intended to make an orange-grove, and
while it was coming to maturity, we expected
to raise early vegetables to ship to northern
markets. We brought with us only money
enough to make our place and live for a year:
by that time we had fully expected to have
returns from vegetable shipments which would
tide us over till another crop. We had plenty
of faith and courage, and were troubled by no
doubts as to the feasibility of our plans. Nor
need we have been, if only our land had contained
the proper elements for vegetable growing.
It was good enough orange land, but it
would be a long time before we could depend
on oranges for an income.</p>

<p>All this time we had been learning many
things, taking care, as we began to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the situation, to go to practical doers for advice
instead of to visionary talkers.</p>

<p>There began to be serious consultations in
our little home circle. The year was drawing
to a close, and our whole crop of vegetables
would not have filled a two-quart measure. We
had gone on with our planting, even after we
felt it to be hopeless, because we did not dare
to stop and listen to our fears. It is not strange
that we felt depressed and disappointed. We
could see that our plans could easily have been
carried out, had we only known just what sort
of land to select. The whole State was before
us to choose from, but we had been misled
through the romances of a dreamer of dreams.
All we had to show for our money, time, and
labor was a small house surrounded by trees
so young that they were at least five years from
yielding us an income, and there was no more
money for experiments.</p>

<p>For a while we felt rather bitter towards our
misleading adviser, but I know now that we
were wrong to feel so. A man can give only
what he has. "Out of the fulness of the heart
the mouth speaketh." A dreamer of dreams
has only visions to offer to his followers, surely
landing them either in the briers of difficulty
or the mires of discouragement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>One day Julius returned from the nearest
large town, where he had been for supplies,
with an unusually thoughtful countenance.
As soon as his purchases were unloaded and
the horse had been attended to, he came in and,
drawing a chair beside my work-table, opened
the conversation with these memorable words:</p>

<p>"Judith, how would you like to go up to
Lemonville to live?"</p>

<p>"What makes you ask?" questioned I. "It
depends altogether on the circumstances how
I'd like to live there."</p>

<p>"Well, Hawkes bantered me to-day to come up
and keep his books for him, and I have been considering
it all the way home. It looks like a way
out, and I'll declare I don't see any other!"</p>

<p>"Go back to office work!" I exclaimed; "I
thought you were done with that sort of thing!"</p>

<p>"I thought so, too; but after a year of this
sort of thing, it begins to look quite different."</p>

<p>We sat up late, discussing this plan in all
its bearings. Bruno seemed to know that it
was a crisis in our affairs, and sat on end facing
us, wrinkling his brows and looking from one
to the other as each spoke. We finally decided
that Julius was to go back to town in a day or
two, and investigate further.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>When Julius returned from Lemonville three
days later, he brought us the news that he had
promised to give the position a trial, and that
he had engaged temporary quarters for us in a
new house near the office. Moreover, we were
to move up there the following week, as Mr.
Hawkes was impatient for his help.</p>

<p>While we felt relieved at this decision, there
was still something very sad about the breaking
up. We had builded so many hopes into our
pine-woods home, which had seemed to us to
be guarded by a "standing army" of giants
carrying silver banners, especially imposing
on moonlight nights when the wind kept the
banners of moss swaying under the immense
pine-trees.</p>

<p>We had seen it in imagination blossoming as
the rose, a quiet little nest, far from the madding
crowd. And now to abandon it at the
beginning and go back to village life,&mdash;it was
leaving poetry for the flattest of prose.</p>

<p>The first step towards breaking up was to
dispose of our fowls. This was soon arranged,
and when the cart came to carry them off,
Bruno watched the loading of them with the
keenest interest, turning his head sideways,
with alert ears, and catching his lip between his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
side-teeth when a hen squawked, as was his
way when nervous. At last they were all in
the coop. The driver mounted to his seat, and
started off. Bruno trotted along after him,
evidently not understanding that they were no
longer our chickens. He thought it was the
beginning of the move he had heard us discuss.
He followed along for perhaps a quarter of a
mile. All at once he stopped and looked back;
he saw us standing and looking after him. It
was a dilemma. He looked after the receding
wagon, then back at us, then at the wagon
again. Then he turned and galloped back,
stomach to earth, and bounded up to us, yelping
and panting, while we explained that they
were not our chickens any more; they were
sold, and had gone away to live in another
home.</p>

<p>The poultry disposed of, we began hurriedly
to make ready for our own departure. It took
a whole long day to pack our books, but we
soon stowed our other things, and inside of the
agreed time we were transferred and settled in
the three rooms Julius had engaged.</p>

<p>There was a sitting-room below, which we
used also as a dining-room, with a small kitchen
behind it. Over the sitting-room we had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
large chamber. The front windows of this
room gave on the sloping roof which covered
a lower porch. This seemed to meet Bruno's
views; he at once sprang through one of the
windows, and took possession of it as a lounging-place&mdash;airy
and cool.</p>

<p>Again and again friends we had made in our
sylvan retreat, who came up to town to visit
us, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I found where you lived by seeing your
dog on the porch-roof."</p>

<p>The house stood on rising ground and could
be seen from almost any part of the village;
so we found Bruno quite useful as a door-plate
in a town where there were as yet no street
names nor numbers.</p>

<p>We do not like living in the homes of other
people, so as soon as possible we made arrangements
for two town lots, and put up a little
cottage.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>One day Julius came home with invitations
for a ball in honor of the Governor,
to be given in an ambitious embryo city across
the lake. He had learned that the little steamer
was to make an extra night-trip across on purpose
to accommodate those who wished to attend,
and that some of our friends had planned
to go in company, and wished us to join their
party. We had long intended to take the
steamer trip across the lake; the Governor's
ball sounded inviting, also the night crossing
with our friends. We decided to accept.</p>

<p>The evening fell rather threatening, with
flurries of wind and rain. Still we were
undaunted, and kept hoping it would clear
off.</p>

<p>I filled Bruno's basin and platter, telling him
he must take care of the house and be a good
dog. He seemed to understand all about it,
and stood at the window after we had locked
him in, watching us go with perfect composure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>It was still twilight when we started, and we
could see his eyes shining through the glass, as
long as the house was in sight.</p>

<p>The weather, meantime, had not improved,
and had we not promised to go, we should certainly
have given it up.</p>

<p>When we reached the wharf, we found that
the little steamer's cabin was in the sole possession
of our party, all the others having backed
out on account of the weather.</p>

<p>We kept up each other's spirits with all sorts
of absurdities, and the boat was soon ploughing a
foamy track across the big waves.</p>

<p>As soon as we steamed out from behind a
point of land that sheltered the wharf, we were
met by a gale of wind that made the little
steamer reel and tremble as if from the shock
of a collision. The lights were all promptly
extinguished, as the doors were forced open by
fierce winds, while we huddled together in a
corner, and laughingly reminded each other that
it was a "pleasure exertion."</p>

<p>I shudder now whenever I think of that night,
though at the time we did not know enough
about the possibilities to be frightened.</p>

<p>How the little boat pitched and tossed! The
waves washed its lower decks, again and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
putting out the engine fires; we meanwhile
rolling in the trough of the sea until they could
be rekindled. We had expected to cross in
about three-quarters of an hour, and return
soon after midnight; but it was along towards
the wee sma' hours when we reached the other
shore. Then, when we heard the crew congratulating
each other, exchanging experiences,
and telling what they had expected to see happen
to all concerned every time big waves had
washed out the fire, we for the first time fully
realized the risks we had taken in crossing.</p>

<p>We were weary enough not to be sorry that
the ball was already over. We looked in at its
departed glories for a few minutes; and then,
finding it would be impossible to start back
home before broad daylight, began to look for
a lodging-place.</p>

<p>The town was filled with people who had
driven in from the surrounding country for the
ball, but we succeeded in getting two small
top-story rooms in the hotel, which were vacated
for us by some sort of "doubling-up" among
the good-natured guests. The three men of our
party took one, and we three women the other.</p>

<p>It was about three o'clock when we retired to
our room, and while the other two slept on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
one bed, I sat by the window trying to hurry
the dawn; wondering what Bruno was thinking,
and how we should look, a party of people
clothed in evening array, returning home in
broad daylight. As if we had made a night of
it, surely! I chuckled to myself as I compared
our plight with that of Cinderella.</p>

<p>We met at breakfast in the hotel dining-room,
a queer-looking crowd. As we laughed
at each other's appearance, it was hard for each
to realize that he or she looked just as absurd;
but an unprejudiced observer would have found
little to choose between us. As soon as the
meal was over, the three men started out to
find a way to get us all home again. Everything
seemed to conspire to delay us, and it
was half-past twelve at noon when we entered
our own gate, the click of the latch bringing
Bruno's face to the window with a series of
joyful barks.</p>

<p>Poor fellow! His long confinement to the
house, his empty plate and bowl, his joyful
reception of us, and then his springing out to
dash round and round the lot, filled our hearts
with compassion.</p>

<p>As soon as his first burst of enthusiasm was
over, he came in, and crept up to me with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
dejected ears and tail, which in his language
meant "mea culpa." I asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is it, Boonie? What's Boonie been
doing?"</p>

<p>Still lower sank head and tail, and his knees
began to weaken. I made a hasty survey of
the sitting-room, and then I understood. He
had slept on the lounge, a thing he was strictly
forbidden to do.</p>

<p>"Oh, Boonie!" I cried, "you naughty dog!
Judith thought she could trust you!"</p>

<p>At this his knees gave way, and he sank to
the floor utterly dejected. He would not rise,
nor even look up, until I had forgiven and comforted
him.</p>

<p>The next time we had to leave him alone in
the house, I built a "booby-trap," with two
light chairs on the lounge, which left him looking
so utterly crushed that I never had the
heart to do it again. But he never more transgressed
in that way, so I felt that I had dealt
wisely with him.</p>

<p>It was a hard necessity which forced us to
shut him up when we were going where it
would not do to take him. At first we had
tried leaving him outside; but we found that
after we had been gone awhile, his heart was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
always sure to fail him, and he would track us,
turning up invariably just in time to cover us
with confusion, his own dejected mien saying
plainly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know this is against orders, but I just <i>had</i>
to do it."</p>

<p>He had a wonderful development of conscience.
We sometimes thought that this, as
well as the other mental gifts of which he
showed himself to be possessed, were due to the
shape of his head. His nose was very short,
and his forehead unusually high and well-rounded.
Of course his life as a close companion
to humans and as a full member of a
family circle, was calculated to foster these
mental gifts; but they were surely there, to
begin with. We might treat dozens of dogs
just as we treated Bruno, without developing
another that would compare with him. He was
unique; and I shall always glory in the fact
that he loved and trusted us. His was a love
not to be lightly won, nor, once given, ever to
be recalled.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p>In spite of our snug little home in Lemonville,
we never felt quite settled there.
We were not built for village life. Country
life is good, and city life is good; but in a village
one has all the drawbacks of both, with
the rewards of neither. So it was not long
before we resolved on another change.</p>

<p>We sold our little home furnished, packed up
our books, with a few other personal belongings,
and turned our faces towards St. Augustine,
to investigate several openings there, of
which we had chanced to hear. We were so
fortunate as to be able to rent a small cottage,
and at once took possession, furnishing it from
our trunks, only buying a few necessary articles
of the plainest kind.</p>

<p>Just as we had settled ourselves in these
temporary quarters, a matter of business came
up, making necessary a return to Lemonville
for a day or two. The trip was both tedious
and expensive, so after some discussion we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
decided that Bruno and I should stay and keep
house, while Julius made the trip alone "light
weight."</p>

<p>I had some trouble in persuading Julius that
I should be perfectly safe in Bruno's care. He
wished us to close the cottage, and go to some
one of the many pleasant boarding-places, where
we had friends or acquaintances stopping. This
I should certainly have done, had I been alone;
but I reminded Julius how more than able
Bruno was to take care of me, and how much
trouble he always gave in a strange house. So
he was finally persuaded that it would be best
for us to stay in the cottage.</p>

<p>Julius left on a noon train, carrying only a
small hand-bag. When he said good-by to us,
he impressed this on Bruno's mind,&mdash;"Take
good care of Judith."</p>

<p>Bruno stood at the door with me, watching
him out of sight, then breathed a deep sigh,
and crept off under the bed to have it out with
himself alone and unseen. I busied myself
picking up the articles which had been scattered
in the confusion of packing, then sat down to
drown thought in a book.</p>

<p>Towards evening I had a caller. One of our
friends, who had seen Julius, bag in hand, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the station, and had thus learned that I was
alone, sent a message by her little son that I
was to "come right around" to their house for
the night. I sent our thanks, with further
message that Bruno and I had agreed to take
care of each other. The child went home;
then his mother came. She thought I "must
be crazy" to think of staying alone. She
"wouldn't do it for any money." I assured
her I was not staying alone, and had some
trouble to convince her that I could not possibly
be more safely guarded than by Bruno. I
assured her, further, that nothing would now
induce me to lock up the house and leave it,
for it would be impossible to know just when
Julius would return; he would be sure to catch
the first boat and train after his business was
finished, and I would not for anything have
him return to find his nest deserted.</p>

<p>I succeeded, at last, in quieting all of her
kind objections, and was left in peace.</p>

<p>Darkness came on, and then Bruno lost courage.
As I was preparing his evening meal, he
ran to meet me as I crossed the room, and raising
himself to an upright position, he rested his
paws on my shoulders and gazed with mournful
questioning into my eyes. I knew what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
would say, and sitting down, I drew his head
to my knee, and told him all about it,&mdash;that
Julius would only stay a "little, little while,"
then he would come back and "stay&mdash;stay&mdash;stay
always with us." His ears rose and fell,
his forehead wrinkled and unwrinkled as I
talked to him. Then he seemed comforted, and
ate a good supper.</p>

<p>I sat reading far into the night, until the
letters began to blur. Bruno sat beside me,
sometimes with his head on my knee while I
stroked his silken ears,&mdash;which always suggested
the wavy locks of a red-haired girl,&mdash;and
sometimes he lay at full length on the
floor, with his head against my feet.</p>

<p>As midnight tolled, I closed my book, covered
up the fire, and tried to go to sleep, with
Bruno lying on the rug beside my bed. Whenever
I stirred, he got up, and putting his forefeet
on the side of the bed, reached his head
over for me to stroke it. It was the first time I
had ever spent a night in a house with no other
humans, and Bruno seemed to enter thoroughly
into my feelings.</p>

<p>I lay listening to the breakers booming on
the outer bar, wondering how far on his journey
Julius could be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>Dawn looked in at me before I fell asleep;
then I knew nothing until aroused by Bruno's
barks, to find that some one was rapping on the
front door.</p>

<p>After hastily putting on a dressing-gown, I
investigated through a crack made by holding
the door slightly ajar, and found that the same
kind friends had sent to see how I had spent
the night. I gave a glowing account of our
comfort and security, for my morning nap had
thoroughly rested and refreshed me; then I
hastened to prepare some breakfast for Bruno,
meanwhile letting him out for a run in the lot.</p>

<p>After the small household duties were attended
to, I had sat down to finish some souvenirs
I was painting for one of the shops, when
I heard a great din and clatter outside. Bruno,
who was sitting beside me, gravely watching
my work, while now and then he gave a disgusted
snort as he got a good whiff of the turpentine
I was using to thin my paints, started
up, barking and bounding towards the closed
door. I sprang to open it, and was met on the
very threshold by a trembling, half-grown deer.
The gate was open, showing how it had entered,
and there, hesitating at the sight of Bruno and
me, was a motley crowd of boys and dogs. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
at once grasped the situation. Many people in
St. Augustine had such pets, and I was sure
this one must have escaped from the grounds of
its owner, to fall into the hands of the rabble.</p>

<p>I hurried out to shut the gate. Most boys
are more or less cruel; but Spanish boys are
intensely so. When I returned to the porch,
Bruno and the deer were regarding each other
with mutual doubts. I settled Bruno's at once
by laying my hand on his head while I stroked
our gentle visitor, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pretty deer, Boonie mustn't hurt it!"</p>

<p>The deer seemed satisfied too, and to feel
that danger was past. I brought water, and
everything I could think of to offer it to eat.
It was too warm with running to want food,
though, and only took a few swallows of water.
Its lovely, deep eyes suggested all sorts of
romantic thoughts. Of course I quoted, "Come
rest in this bosom," and "I never nursed a dear
gazelle." I was sure its name should be Juanita,
after the girl in the sweet Spanish song.</p>

<p>All day the pretty creature roamed about our
little enclosure, Bruno and I attending to its
wants as best we could, having had no experience
in catering for such guests.</p>

<p>It turned quite chilly towards evening. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
I had shut all the doors and built up the fire,
I heard a clatter of small hoofs on the porch-floor,
and there stood Juanita, looking wistfully
in through the window. Bruno and I
looked at each other, thoroughly perplexed.
We were not prepared for such a hint. I
thought afterwards it must have been taken as
a baby-deer, and raised in-doors "by hand."</p>

<p>We went out and prepared a warm bed for it
in the wood-shed back of the house. It seemed
quite satisfied with this arrangement, and settled
down cosily as we left it and returned to
our fireside. We spent this evening and night
as we had the previous one, and were aroused
very early in the morning by the sound of
Juanita's impatient little hoofs on the porch
floor. I had just finished feeding her and
Bruno, when I heard the gate-latch click. I
looked out. A colored girl was coming up the
walk.</p>

<p>"Mawnin', Lady," she said; "ole Miss hyud
our deer was hyuh. <i>Dah</i> you is, you good-f'-nuffin'
ole runaway! Thanky, Lady. Come
on, Billy!" And hitting <i>him</i> a resounding slap
on the back, she went off, accompanied by our
romantic Juanita, transformed into meek and
prosy Billy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>Thus perish our illusions!</p>

<p>Bruno was inclined to resent this unceremonious
taking off of our pet, and began to growl;
but as soon as I recovered from the mingled
emotions which at first had rendered me speechless,
I realized from Billy's actions that he and
the colored girl were old friends; so I silenced
him by saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never mind, Boonie, it wasn't our deer; it
only came for a little visit, and now it's going
home." Then we stood watching graceful
Billy and his uncouth companion till they disappeared
through the old City Gates.</p>

<p>Late that evening, Bruno having had his
supper, I sat by the fire sipping a cup of chocolate,
and thinking those tender, half-melancholy
thoughts we are apt to have at twilight when
separated from those beloved.</p>

<p>All at once I heard the gate click. Bruno
sprang up, thrilled and alert. A footstep on
the walk&mdash;ah, Bruno knew it, even before I
did, and was so eager to get out that he almost
held the door shut in his excitement. We
finally got it open, and there, weary, eager, and
travel-stained, was Julius! Before his lips
reached my face, I mentally exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How glad I am that Bruno and I have stayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
here, instead of leaving a shut-up house, where
he would have to drop his bag and start out to
look for us!"</p>

<p>That moment, when I felt his arms around
me and heard his words of joy mingled with
Bruno's ecstatic yelps, paid for all of our endless,
lonely hours. I dare say there was not in
all the world a happier group of three than sat
before our open fire that night.</p>

<p>Every time Bruno dozed, he would awaken
with a start, and go to sniff and paw at Julius
to make sure it wasn't a dream, that he really
had come back to us.</p>

<p>Julius reported his business successfully concluded;
a change in one of the time-tables had
enabled him to get back sooner than we had
dared to hope.</p>

<p>The next day I received his letter, telling me
to look for him by the train on which he had
come the night before!</p>

<p>In those days our mail not infrequently took
an ocean voyage on its way from one Florida
town to another quite near by, so we were never
surprised at anything in the mail line,&mdash;except
a prompt delivery!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p>It was shortly after the events related in the
last chapter that we came to a final decision
against the various business openings we
had been investigating in St. Augustine, and
concluded to go on to Jacksonville. We disposed
of the few things we had bought for our
little cottage, and when we again found ourselves
on the train with our household goods, I
gave us both a fit of merriment by quoting the
words of poor little Joe in "Bleak House,"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wisht I may die if I ain't a-movin' on."</p>

<p>It was by this time mid-season, and Jacksonville
was full of tourists. It was then very
popular as a winter resort, Southern Florida
was not much known; so we had some difficulty
in finding a place to live.</p>

<p>We decided to get just one room somewhere,
and board at a restaurant till the city emptied
so we could secure a cottage.</p>

<p>The first room we found that would do, was
too far from the business part of town; so we
took it for only a month, and kept on looking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
We heard of one, at last, which seemed close
to everything. It proved to be large, lofty, and
pleasant, with a glimpse of the river from its
front windows.</p>

<p>The house was well recommended to us by
the few business acquaintances Julius had made,
though they all confessed that such places were
constantly changing hands and inmates and
that it was hard to keep up with them. Time
pressed, and nothing better offered; so we
moved in. It was entirely bare; so we bought
some furniture, and, as it was rather a long
room for its breadth, we managed, with a screen
or two, to make it seem like three rooms.</p>

<p>When all was in place, it was really quite
inviting. I had a small lamp stove, so we need
only go out for dinners. We began to feel
more settled than for a long time, especially, as
Julius had in the meantime found a business
opening which was entirely satisfactory. We
saw nothing at all of the other lodgers; but this
did not disturb us, as we were in no hurry to
make acquaintances. We felt that it was best
to be circumspect in a city of this size and
make-up.</p>

<p>Our evenings were our pleasantest times, sitting
on either side of the reading-lamp, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Bruno stretched at our feet; so I was inclined
to object one evening, when Julius announced
at dinner that he had promised to give a few
hours to helping a young friend of his to
straighten out his accounts. He had promised,
though; so I had to yield. He set off betimes,
so as to be home earlier. I locked the door
after him, as I always did, and began to make
myself as comfortable as possible for a quiet
hour or two, with a new magazine.</p>

<p>Before I had finished cutting the leaves, I
was struck with surprise at Bruno's actions.
He crept in a very stealthy manner to the door,
and stood there in an attitude of listening, with
every nerve and muscle tense.</p>

<p>I watched him a minute, and then asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is it, Boonie?"</p>

<p>He did not look around; he waved his tail
once or twice, then resumed his tense pose.
Thoroughly surprised, I went softly to him,
and stood also listening. I could hear nothing
but a faint rustling, a suppressed whispering,
and the soft click of a latch. I touched Bruno's
head; he looked up at me, and I saw he was
holding his lip between his side-teeth, as he had
a way of doing when he was very much puzzled
or excited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>I tried to coax him away from the door, but
he refused to come. I made sure the bolt was
shot, and then sat down at a little distance to
watch him. There was a door in the middle of
one side of the room, which, when we took
possession, we had found to be nailed up. We
utilized the recess with the aid of some draperies,
as a place to hang clothing. Bruno went
to this door, thrusting his head in among the
clothes.</p>

<p>He listened there for a long time, probably
ten minutes; he returned again to the other
door; then he gave a low growl, followed by
several half-suppressed barks, and lay down
against it.</p>

<p>I forgot all about my book, and sat watching
to see what he would do next. The evening
seemed endless. At last I heard Julius below
in the hall; Bruno sprang up when I opened
the door, and went clattering down the stairs to
escort him up. It was not late, only about ten.
I at once told Julius of the queer evening we
had spent, and had the satisfaction of seeing
him as thoroughly puzzled as I had been. We
sat until a late hour discussing it, then gave it
up as something quite beyond us.</p>

<p>About three o'clock in the morning we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
awakened by an alarm of fire. The room was
full of light, and when we looked out of the
window we found that it was close by&mdash;only
about two squares away. It was a big blaze
and, as it was on the opposite side of the street,
we had a fine view of it. I was terribly frightened.
My uneasiness earlier in the evening had
unnerved me, and this terrible fire so near us
upset me completely. A fire fills me with horror,
especially if it breaks out in the night: it
always reminds me of the burning of a big
steamer that happened one awful night in my
tenth year.</p>

<p>I watched the flames, fascinated by their lurid
splendor;&mdash;imagining that the three white
pigeons which had been awakened by the light
and were circling around the tower of smoke&mdash;now
hidden by it, and now silhouetted against
it&mdash;were the souls of those who had perished
in the flames. Overcome by horror, I finally
exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Suppose it had been this big building that
had caught fire!"</p>

<p>"But it wasn't," said Julius.</p>

<p>"No: but it might have been. I don't like
this at all. I want to be in a little house by
ourselves, close to the ground."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>"Yes, it would be better," said Julius, who
saw by the light of the flames how pale I had
become, and noted how I was trembling. "It
will not do to have you so terrified: we'll
make a change at once. But it will be difficult
to find a house until the tourists begin to
scatter."</p>

<p>We thoroughly discussed the situation, and
by breakfast-time had reached a decision.</p>

<p>I was to return to Lemonville for a stay of a
week or two, and while there to see to the
packing and shipping of a piano we had left in
storage. Julius meanwhile was to find a cottage,
and have our belongings transferred to it.
We did not like the arrangement very well, but
it seemed to be the only thing we could do.</p>

<p>Thus ended our experience as lodgers.</p>

<p>I was gone two weeks. It was pleasant to
meet old friends, after a separation long enough
to have plenty of news to exchange, without
having had time to lose interest in each other's
affairs, but my heart was back in Jacksonville.</p>

<p>Julius and I wrote to each other every day,
but the mails were so tedious and uncertain
that we usually got each other's letters by
threes or fours, with days full of anxiety and
heart-ache between.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>I still have the package of letters received
then. I have just been reading them over
again. Bruno pervades them all. It is&mdash;</p>

<p>"Took Bruno with me to the office to-day, he
begged so hard when I started to leave him;
it's lonely for him, poor fellow!"</p>

<p>And&mdash;</p>

<p>"While I ate breakfast, I had the waiter put
up a good lunch for Boonie; he's getting tired
of biscuit, and I don't like to give him raw
bones."</p>

<p>On Sunday,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I took Bruno a long walk in the suburbs
to-day. It did him a lot of good."</p>

<p>A letter written just before I returned
says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bruno seems down-hearted to-night; I think
he misses somebody."</p>

<p>I returned as soon as Julius wrote that he had
procured a house. The welcome I received
told me that Bruno was not the only one who
had missed "somebody."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p>All that season we lived in a rented cottage,
but before the next summer came
we were planting roses in our own grounds.
We had been renting just about a year, when
we bought our little home in one of the suburbs;
so we could fully appreciate the joys of being
on our own place again.</p>

<p>We found a kitten, the "very moral" of
Rebecca, striped black and blue-gray. She was
a dear little thing, and she and Bruno soon
became fast friends.</p>

<p>The only creature we ever knew him to bite&mdash;except,
indeed, wild animals, which he considered
fair game&mdash;was in defending Catsie.</p>

<p>His victim was a handsome coach-dog, following
some friends who one day drove out to
call on us. He was a thoroughbred dog, but
he had not Bruno's gentlemanly instincts.
The first thing he did was to go trotting
around to the back porch, where he spied Catsie
enjoying a fine meaty bone. He sneaked up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
behind her, and snatching it in his teeth, made
off with it.</p>

<p>Bruno could not stand that. It seemed to
make a perfect fury of him. I think he felt
that the fault was worse, because the coach-dog
was so sleek and plump; there was not even the
excuse of hunger.</p>

<p>Poor fellow! Bruno sent him howling and
limping from the yard.</p>

<p>The call came to an untimely end, our visitors
declaring,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That great savage brute of yours has almost
killed our beautiful dog!"</p>

<p>I am afraid we did not feel very contrite.
We never took our "great savage brute" anywhere
to visit, except when he was especially
invited; and besides, we had our own opinion,
which was similar to Bruno's, of big dogs that
robbed little cats.</p>

<p>It took a great deal to rouse Bruno, so much
that we sometimes mistook his amiability for
lack of courage.</p>

<p>We had often watched him chasing the animals
that lax town laws had allowed to roam
the streets of the only two villages we had ever
known. He would go dashing after a pig or a
cow. If the creature ran, he would chase it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
until he was exhausted; but if it stood its
ground and calmly returned his excited gaze,
he would stop, look at it for a minute, then
turn and come trotting back, with an air that
said plainly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was only in fun; I wanted to see what it
would do."</p>

<p>There was a big watch-dog which lived in an
enclosure we had to pass on our way to town.
When we took Bruno that way for a stroll, as
soon as he reached this lot, he and the other
dog would greet each other through the picket-fence
with the most blood-curdling growls and
snarls. They seemed fairly to thirst for each
other's life-blood. Then, each on his own side
of the fence, they would go racing along, keeping
up their growls and snarls, till they reached
a place where there were half a dozen pickets
broken out, so that either could have leaped
through with ease.</p>

<p>Then what a change!</p>

<p>Their ears would droop, and their coats and
tempers smooth down to the most insipid amiability.
But at their next meeting they were
quite as savage, till they again reached the
opening in the fence. It was the same program,
over and over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>Bruno liked to play at anger just for a little
excitement, but when he found anything really
worth a spell of the furies, it was quite another
story.</p>

<p>The butcher-boy, who came every other day,
took Bruno's tragic demonstrations for the real
thing, and was terribly afraid of him. He used
to shout to me, "Come out and hold the dog!"
until he could run to the kitchen and get safely
back outside the gate.</p>

<p>It was all in vain for me to assure him there
was no danger. He thought I did not know
what I was talking about. His terror was so
real, I pitied the child&mdash;he was not more than
twelve or fourteen&mdash;so I used to shut Bruno
up in the front hall on butcher-boy days until
after he had made his call.</p>

<p>Our colored woman used to spend her nights
in the bosom of her family, coming back every
morning in time to get breakfast. One morning
she failed to appear. It was butcher-boy
morning, and the weather was quite chilly.
When I called Bruno in to shut him up, I
noticed that the house next to ours was closed.
Our neighbors were off for the day. There
were two vacant lots opposite our place, and on
the other side, a church. So when our neigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>bors
went off for a day's jaunt, as they frequently
did, we were quite isolated.</p>

<p>After I had shut Bruno in the hall, I sat
down by the kitchen fire to toast my toes and
wait for the butcher-boy. I was impatient for
him to come, so I could release Bruno, who did
not like being shut up. He was perfectly willing
to lie in the hall,&mdash;in fact, it was a favorite
dozing-place with him,&mdash;but, like some people,
he did not enjoy the idea of being forced to do
even what he liked best. I was glad when I
heard a step on the back porch, and sprang
eagerly to open the door. There stood the
dirtiest, most evil-looking tramp I had ever
seen. He was so taken aback at the way the
door flew open, that I had slammed it and shot
the bolt before he recovered. I hurried in for
Bruno, who had heard the strange step and was
eager to investigate. As soon as I returned
and unfastened the bolt, the tramp threw his
weight against the door to force it open. Bruno
sprang to the opening with a whole volley of
barks and growls. I caught his collar, saying
to the tramp,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You'd better run; I can't hold him long!"</p>

<p>I never saw a man make better time. I gave
him a minute's start, then loosed Bruno. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
reached the fence just as the tramp had fallen
over it without stopping to open the gate.
When I saw all was safe, I felt so limp I fell
back in a chair weak and nerveless. Bruno
watched the tramp around the corner, then
returned to look after me. He was much exercised
to find me in such a state, and relieved
his feelings by alternately trying to lick my
face, and dashing out to bark again after the
vanished tramp.</p>

<p>After that, Bruno seemed to feel more than
ever responsible for me. He had all along been
my especial protector, but seeing me overcome
with fright seemed to make a deep impression
on him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p>Julius and I had been in the habit of taking
evening walks, and as Bruno stayed with
me through the day when Julius was gone, it
was his only chance for a run.</p>

<p>One evening, when Julius came home, it had
been raining, and I felt that it would not do for
me to go out.</p>

<p>"You'd better take Boonie for a little run,
though," I said; "he has been in the house all
day."</p>

<p>"I have an errand down at the corner," answered
Julius, "and he can race around the
square while I am attending to it. You won't
be afraid?"</p>

<p>"Not for that little while; you will be back
again before I have time to miss you."</p>

<p>Julius went into the hall for his overcoat and
hat.</p>

<p>"Come on, Boonie," he said; "Boonie can
go."</p>

<p>Bruno bounced up, all excitement, showing
how he had felt the confinement.  He dashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
into the hall, where Julius was putting on his
overcoat, then came trotting back into the sitting-room
and stood, ears erect, looking at me
and wagging his tail. I understood him, and
answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, Boonie; Judith must stay. Just Julius
and Boonie are going."</p>

<p>He knew us only by the names he heard us
call each other.</p>

<p>He sat down at my feet, all his excitement
gone.</p>

<p>"Come, Boonie," called Julius from the door.
"Come on, Boonie's going!"</p>

<p>Bruno looked at him, wagged his tail, looked
at me, and refused to stir.</p>

<p>"Don't you see?" I said; "he thinks I ought
not to be left alone." Then to him, "Go on,
Boonie; Boonie must go. Judith isn't afraid."</p>

<p>He looked gratefully at me, and wagged his
tail, saying plainly, in his dog-fashion,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank you, but I'd rather not."</p>

<p>Julius waxed impatient.</p>

<p>"You Boon! come along, sir! come on!" he
thundered. Bruno's ears and tail drooped. He
looked up sideways in a deprecating manner
at Julius, then came and laid his head on my
knee. It was of no use. Neither threats nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
coaxing could move him. Noble creature! His
ideas of chivalry were not to be tampered with,
even by those who were his gods, his all!</p>

<p>The next morning at breakfast I said to
Julius,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am afraid Bruno will be ill staying in-doors
so closely. Can't you take him for a
little run before you go to the office?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Julius, "I'll take him if
he'll go."</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll go fast enough. Dinah is here,
and he will think it safe to leave me."</p>

<p>Bruno was delighted at the invitation, and
went tearing around the square four times
while Julius walked it once; then came in, hot
and happy, to tell Catsie and me all about it.</p>

<p>There was something so peculiarly tender
about our feelings for Bruno and his for us.
He was at once our protector and our dependent.
It is not strange that we never failed to
be thoroughly enraged when dog-lovers tried,
as they sometimes did, to coax us to sell him.
Sell our Bruno! True, we had tried to give
him away, but that was for his own good.
But to take money for him! To sell him!!
Unspeakable!!!</p>

<p>Three times we had nursed him through try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>ing
illnesses,&mdash;twice the blind staggers, and
once the distemper; and when either of us was
ill, he could not be coaxed from the bedside.
No matter who watched at night, Bruno would
watch too, and no slightest sound nor movement
escaped his vigilance.</p>

<p>How often since he left us have I longed in
weary vigils for the comfort of his presence!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p>In looking back at that winter, most of its
evenings seem to have been spent before the
open fire, the room lighted only by its blaze.</p>

<p>Sometimes Little Blossom lay across my
knees, the firelight mirrored in her thoughtful
eyes, her pink toes curling and uncurling to the
heat. Sometimes she lay cradled in Julius's
arms, while he crooned old ditties remembered
from his own childhood.</p>

<p>Bruno never seemed to tire of studying this
new-comer to our home circle. He would stand
with ears drooped forward, watching me bathe
and dress her, so absorbed in contemplation
that he would start when I spoke, as if he had
forgotten my existence.</p>

<p>He had always before seemed intensely jealous
when Julius or I had noticed children, but
with Little Blossom it was different; he seemed
to share our feelings,&mdash;she was <i>our</i> baby.</p>

<p>At first he showed a disposition to play with
her as he had long ago romped with Rebecca's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
kittens, but after I had once explained to him
that she was too little and tender for such
frolics, that he must wait till she could run
about, he seemed quite satisfied, and constituted
himself her guardian, as he had always been
mine. While she slept, he would lie beside
her crib. When she took an airing, it was his
delight to walk proudly beside the carriage.
When I held her, he sat at my elbow; and
when she laughed and cooed in her romps with
Julius, he would make short runs around the
room, barking his delight.</p>

<p>Happy hours, all too short!</p>

<p>As spring advanced, our Little Blossom
drooped. Her brain had always been in advance
of her physical development. She had
never the meaningless stare seen in normal
babies. Instead, there was a wistful, pensive
expression as she gazed into the fire or through
the window, with always a quick dimpling
smile when either of us spoke to her. There
was much sickness in town, especially among
young children. We decided to spend the summer
months at the seashore. A cottage was
leased, and trunks were packed full of summer
clothes, draperies, and other joys and comforts.</p>

<p>When the time came to start, the cry arose,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>"Where is Bruno?"</p>

<p>No one knew. None remembered seeing him
since breakfast. It was now half-past ten.
The train was to go at eleven, and we were
three-quarters of a mile from the station! We
felt utterly lost. It was impossible to leave
Bruno, and yet we must go.</p>

<p>Julius looked in all directions, calling and
whistling. No answer. Our baggage had gone,
a wagon full of it. The tickets were bought,
and everything was arranged.</p>

<p>Julius came in from an unsuccessful search,
a look of desperation on his face.</p>

<p>"There's no help for it," he said; "we must
start, Bruno or no Bruno."</p>

<p>We locked up the house and set off. As we
drove along, I kept looking out, hoping to see
the familiar form come dashing after us, but in
vain. Julius was to come into town each morning
to the office, returning to us at the seashore
on the afternoon train. I began to think I
could not know Bruno's fate (for I feared
something serious must have happened) until
the afternoon of the next day. We had been
so delayed it was necessary to make all speed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 343px;">

<span class="caption">Chasing Crabs and Sea-Birds.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Page 111.</span></span>
</div>

<p>We hurried into the station, and there, standing
beside our heap of luggage, one eye for the
packages and the other on the lookout for us,
stood Bruno!</p>

<p>He greeted us with such extravagant delight,
and we felt so relieved at seeing him, that we
found no reproaches ready. Besides, although
he had so delayed us, it was quite evident that
he had thought we had our hands over-full,
and that by keeping his eye on the things he
would be helping us. So he had followed the
wagon, overlooked the unloading, and evidently
had kept tally of every package. Our man
who had driven the wagon was to go on with
us to help in the transfer at the other end, and
to make all ready for comfort in the cottage.
He told us that Bruno had mounted guard over
him as well as our effects, and while rather
overdoing it, had been quite helpful.</p>

<p>It is hard to write of the weeks that followed.</p>

<p>I see Bruno racing up and down the beach
and swimming out through the breakers, while
Julius and I sit on either side of a little wicker
wagon drawn up beyond the reach of the tide,
watching him.</p>

<p>I see him chasing crabs and sea-birds, or
limping up to show us his foot stung by a
stranded jelly-fish.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a><br /><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>It is night in a long white-draped room.</p>

<p>One end of it is lighted by a lamp having a
rose-colored shade.</p>

<p>In the middle of the lighted end stands a
crib. A little white-robed form lies within.</p>

<p>The pink light so simulates a glow of health
that the mother, sitting beside the crib, bends
low, thinking the little breast heaves.</p>

<p>But no. The waxen cheeks chill her lips.</p>

<p>Still she bends and gazes on that loved little
form.</p>

<p>Bruno lies at the mother's feet. When she
moves he rises, looking mournfully into the
crib, then turns to rest his head on her knee.</p>

<p>On a lounge, in the end of the room where
shadows lurk, the father lies asleep, exhausted
with grief.</p>

<p>The curtains sway in the open windows, as if
the room were breathing. All else is still.</p>

<p>I see all this as if it were a scene in a dream
or as a picture,&mdash;something in which I have no
part; and yet I feel that my heart throbbed in
that mother's bosom.</p>

<p>I know that after she had sent away all kind
friends, to watch alone that last night, it was
literally and truly a "white night" to her.</p>

<p>She felt neither sorrow nor grief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>Yesterday her heart was torn with anguish,
when those heavenly eyes grew dim with the
death-glaze.</p>

<p>To-morrow it will be rent again, when the
little form is hidden from her in its white
casket; and again&mdash;at that bitterest moment
Life can give&mdash;when the first handful of earth
makes hollow echo above it.</p>

<p>But to-night there is the uplifted feeling of
perfect peace.</p>

<p>Although it is the third sleepless night, there
is no thought of weariness. All through the
short hours she sits and feasts her eyes on the
angelic face with its look of joy unutterable.</p>

<p>And Bruno watches with her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next day Bruno does not ask to join the
sad procession leaving the cottage.</p>

<p>He has no thought for self at such a time.</p>

<p>As it turns the corner, his mournful eyes are
seen at the window, gazing after his little playmate
who is being carried away.</p>

<p>Or does he realize it is only the beautiful
body they are taking, which was all too frail
for the bright spirit now flown these two days
since!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p>Again the mother is in the city home.
No crib stands by the fireplace; no tiny
garments are spread out to air. All is orderly
as in the years that now seem so far away.</p>

<p>She sits with book or needle.</p>

<p>The book falls to her knee, the work slips
to the floor; tears steal down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Bruno presses near, his head against her
arm. With his uplifted, pleading eyes, he
seems to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't cry, Judith, please don't cry."</p>

<p>Oh, matchless comforter!</p>

<p>After a time we notice that Bruno is growing
old and feeble.</p>

<p>Do we grieve at this? Far from it. We feel
that life is over for us; our only thought is to
escape its grasp and join our Little Blossom.</p>

<p>We could never leave Bruno alone; he would
grieve himself to death, and meanwhile, perhaps,
be abused as a stupid brute for refusing
to be comforted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>So it is with a feeling of sad resignation that
we realize how his hold on life is weakening.
At least he will die in comfort, ministered to
by his loved ones.</p>

<p>We sit alone, we three, in the twilight,&mdash;Julius
and I, with Bruno at our feet,&mdash;talking
of the future. We speculate on the Beyond,
hoping it will not be the conventional Heaven,
with harps and crowns.</p>

<p>We long for a sheltered nook, near the River
of Life, where we and Little Blossom can resume
the life so happily begun here, going over to
the Happy Hunting Grounds to get Bruno, and
to the Cat Heaven for Rebecca and Catsie.</p>

<p>Then, our family circle complete, we would
settle down to an eternity of <span class="smcap">Home</span>.</p>

<p>Can Heaven itself offer anything sweeter
than home,&mdash;the wedded home, where love
abides!</p>

<p>One morning Bruno seemed not to care for
his breakfast. He sniffed daintily at it, and
turned away, though I tried to tempt him with
everything he liked best.</p>

<p>He rested his head on my knee, looking gratefully
into my eyes, while his tail waved his
thanks.</p>

<p>Then he went to his bed, and lying down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
upon it, he fell asleep,&mdash;not a short uneasy
nap, with ears open for every sound, but a
deep, dreamless sleep.</p>

<p>There was a beautiful young fig-tree in our
lot. Under this his grave was dug. His bed
was laid in, he on it, with his blanket wrapped
around him.</p>
